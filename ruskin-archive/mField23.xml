            <p>never leaves happiness behind – </p>
            <p>gifts in bronze, or book, or </p>
            <p>flowers &amp; memories of luring </p>
            <p>moods: pantomime, that enthralls, </p>

            <p>on his Escape &amp; recovery.</p>
            <p>He comes up to me with eyes </p>
            <p>that have been brightened by </p>

            <p>But it is not any question of </p>

            <p>The effect of this <hi rend="underline">pietà</hi> is of </p>

            <p>poetry, if not of the highest, all </p>

            <p>that you occasionally fall </p>
            <p>into a certain Don-ishness, a </p>

            <p>one must delve for sense. I </p>
            <p>like too many of the poems to tell </p>
            <p>you which I prefer. On the whole </p>
            <p>those wh : are most Greek in </p>
            <p>theme &amp; most impersonal in </p>
            <p>address. And those few Greek </p>

            <p>it by simple hearing. </p>
            <p>I believe prisoners at the </p>

            <p>Great things arrive thus – </p>
            <p>humbly –, as Kings &amp; poets, &amp; </p>

            <p>And Vincent turns to the </p>
            <p>subject:</p>
            <p>“To become what we sing” –</p>
            <p>That is what God did– He </p>
            <p>became Man that he might </p>
            <p>teach Man a New Song. </p>
            <p>It was only by hearing that </p>
            <p>sorrow He could do any-</p>
            <p>-thing great for Man. So with </p>
            <p>the poet, he must bear Sin. </p>
            <p>I explain further the strong </p>

            <p>as the result of my Conversion – </p>
            <p>I will not avow it. I have </p>

            <p>puts on me – &amp;, of course, </p>

            <p>Then at the next Confession, with the </p>

            <p>of the Confessional, I find my Confessor </p>
            <p>stern, when I had been aware </p>
            <p>of a great, decisive victory. The </p>
            <p>‘Miserere’ is given as penance </p>
            <p>again &amp; I have the agony of a feeling </p>

            <p>becoming wormwood when </p>
            <p>Goscommon’s “Pray for me” is a </p>
            <p>careless, nearly dropped formality. </p>
            <p>I had been unfortunate in the </p>
            <p>impression I gave – for I was going </p>
            <p>away on a Lent Holiday; I had </p>
            <p>to say I could not fast (contemptuously </p>

            <p>Friday I <del>was to</del><add>should</add> find it was going </p>
            <p>too hard with me) – &amp; I had forgotten </p>
            <p>the Stationes Crucis on <unclear>the</unclear> Friday; </p>
            <p>I think he thought I was ‘relapsing’ </p>
            <p>fast &amp; making Lent an occasion </p>
            <p>for levity – the Lent when I who </p>
            <p>had never spent a Catholic Lent, </p>
            <p>was also receiving, by the Church’s </p>
            <p>wonderful grace, the Bread of </p>
            <p>Life every day.</p>
            <p>Since this Confession it seemed as if </p>

            <p>The hard black olive-shaped eyes </p>

            <p>The wonderful cloudy eyes gave a </p>
            <p>scimitar-sweep to see if we were </p>
            <p>there. The sermon’s text “Then he </p>
            <p>began to fear &amp; be very heavy”. I went </p>
            <p>hot all over – ‘burns’ of anguish </p>
            <p>all over the nerves as at some </p>
            <p>intolerable cruelty – Vincent can </p>
            <p>be so intolerable on the subject </p>
            <p>of pain – he can make one’s mind </p>
            <p>writhe as no man should. </p>
            <p>But we escaped – though he spoke </p>
            <p>entirely on the mental agony of </p>
            <p>Christ, who bore every mental </p>
            <p>torture, except actual guilt. </p>
            <p>Vincent spoke of fear – of the </p>
            <p>maiming fear of childhood </p>
            <p>that often dwell on to the day </p>
            <p>of death – he spoke of the shames </p>
            <p>of childhood, the <unclear>fringes</unclear> of </p>
            <p>which are scarcely lifted in </p>
            <p>the Confessional by the tenderest </p>
            <p>Confessor – Love bears all fear </p>
            <p>&amp; all shame for its beloved. Then </p>
            <p>he spoke of Love’s own particular </p>
            <p>Emotions of flying from the </p>
            <p>Beloved, the pain of leaving the </p>
            <p>Beloved – as Christ has left the </p>
            <p>Saints . . . all indeed of His Elected </p>
            <p>Children, out of love &amp; its necessity. </p>
            <p>He spoke of the hatred Love endured </p>
            <p>from others when it was at its work – </p>
            <p>one of the finest sufferings possible to conceive.</p>

            <p> “Love is a puzzle to the Beloved </p>
            <p>&amp; a puzzle to the Lover as well” </p>
            <p>He spoke finally of the mysterious </p>
            <p>anguish Christ felt for the pain </p>
            <p>He must bring on those to whom </p>
            <p>He came: the Prince of Peace &amp; yet </p>
            <p>a Sword (as His priests often </p>

            <p>bleeding for the pain of the </p>

            <p>as if he were praying for </p>
            <p>our forgiveness in His Sorrow </p>
            <p>for something He had done </p>

            <p>Why does he move down the </p>

            <p>When, at night, I go to Vespers </p>
            <p>3 large candles crown my 6 – </p>
            <p>almost exactly burnt to the </p>
            <p>same height.</p>
            <p>I think he put them there as </p>
            <p>soon as I left. During the </p>

            <p>It is a beautiful thing that in the </p>

            <p>you have lighted the lights of the </p>

            <p>are blessed. A wish that the blessing </p>

            <p>Beloved Painter,</p>
            <p>It is a hideous little disappointment </p>
            <p>not to see you for one moment<add>minute</add> in </p>
            <p>the May. So soon the clouds return </p>

            <p>&amp; to greet the sea in streams, to be </p>
            <p>in the blue streets – &amp; <unclear>row out</unclear></p>
            <p>at night to watch the gt. apple </p>
            <p>orchards in the clouds – I rejoice </p>
            <p>incontinently – Alleluja!</p>
            <p>….</p>
            <p>This is one of the loveliest of springs </p>
            <p>to the eyes. The <unclear>happy</unclear> trees </p>

            <p>&amp; laugh.</p>
            <p>In Italy, I am a little afraid of </p>
            <p>Shannon’s bones. Good greeting </p>
            <p>to him with health. And to </p>
            <p>you all those afflictions despairs </p>
            <p>indignations wonderments </p>
            <p><unclear>convulsions</unclear> &amp; confidence that </p>
            <p>will make you more Painter.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><unclear>Wont</unclear> you go a little further to Sicily </p>
            <p>– where there are the Sicilians? </p>
            <p>I was beginning to want to be back in </p>

            <p>when I discover him in the </p>

            <p>for him – dear Goss, with eyes as </p>
            <p>suspicious as an animal’s. </p>
            <p>He has really been very hard </p>
            <p>or stupid about the Confirmation, </p>
            <p>arranging it should be before </p>

            <p>Duncan’s <metamark>^</metamark><add>human</add> figures have imagination, </p>

            <p>rock &amp; tide of the Infinite </p>
            <p>Desire.</p>
            <p>The Drawings have far more </p>
            <p>genius in them, because genius </p>
            <p>there needs so much less equip-</p>
            <p>-ment for manifestation – one </p>
            <p>drawing is remarkable, it is </p>
            <p>a “found” creation ( in the French </p>
            <p>sense ) inimitable, that never was </p>
            <p>before : a sort of Northern Eros, </p>

            <p>the cry of the sea-bird on his </p>
            <p>mouth, the cruelty of the north </p>
            <p>on his charm, the zeal of conflict </p>
            <p>in his defiance : Eros became </p>
            <p>demoniac in ultima Thule.</p>

            <p>nature must be submerged. Then gradually </p>
            <p>the waters fall – The Earth is the same </p>
            <p>but covered with mud &amp; strewage; </p>

            <p>too, he could not read. Shakspeare </p>

            <p>he read <hi rend="underline">Henry V</hi> – behold, it sang </p>
            <p>true with Catholic sound.</p>
            <p>Soon he took up everything – </p>
            <p>but with changed evaluation </p>
            <p>– often with new interest. He </p>
            <p>discussed the Catholic wisdom </p>

            <p>I must not be sad that I cannot </p>

            <p>Of the last days in Ireland &amp; the Journey </p>

            <p>in his wings &amp; banished </p>
            <p>into the desert-provinces, </p>
            <p>chained to the Holly Cross </p>
            <p>Priory – of that by &amp; bye –</p>
            <p>I go on now to the afternoon </p>
            <p>of Sep. 3<hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi>. I am waiting in </p>
            <p>a parlour with old black chairs </p>
            <p>&amp; portraits made into old portraits </p>
            <p>by time, not their own mellowness. </p>
            <p>Through the window I catch the </p>
            <p><del>Square</del><metamark>^</metamark><add>garden</add> enclosure of the Monastery </p>
            <p>buildings, torn with the rains – </p>
            <p>yet full of the daisied floweriness </p>
            <p>of autumn, bossed with </p>
            <p>French marigolds. And I </p>
            <p>am waiting for Vincent. </p>
            <p>He enters – a white suddenness </p>
            <p>of motion … Yes, his entrance is </p>
            <p>like Mephisto’s, not in calm, </p>
            <p>like Gabriel’s. We shake hands </p>
            <p>&amp; as usual sit on each side the </p>
            <p>little Table. There is no shyness </p>
            <p>between us – anymore than between </p>
            <p>the powers of colloquy in one’s </p>
            <p>own mind. So strange! Before </p>
            <p>this Dominican I feel nothing </p>
            <p>of the hedge of personality that </p>
            <p>forbids one in another person – </p>
            <p>&amp; forgetting one’s own as a familiar </p>

            <p>Confess <unclear>in</unclear> Literature – the Art of </p>
            <p>Words – a singular grace of </p>
            <p>association with the profoundest </p>
            <p>mystery of Genesis.</p>
            <p>This being so, we should expect </p>
            <p>that a vast literature had </p>
            <p>gathered round the perpetual </p>
            <p>Incarnation of the Divine </p>
            <p>Word in the Eucharistic Sacrament. </p>
            <p>And the father <del>spoke</del><metamark>^</metamark><add>speaks</add> of Philosophy </p>

            <p>he does not dwell more on the </p>
            <p>“imperial” St. Thomas. </p>
            <p>Then he passes to theology </p>
            <p>– again I <del>have</del> miss<del>ed</del> the </p>

            <p>He comes to Poetry. As yet </p>
            <p>there has been no Dramatic </p>
            <p>Poetry or Epic poetry in honour </p>
            <p>of the Church’s mysteries </p>

            <p>Challenge. It stirs forth &amp; </p>
            <p>instantly beats its pulses </p>
            <p>in my heart. It <del>was</del> is not</p>

            <p>of stream – it <del>was</del><add>is</add> a </p>
            <p>living flight through the </p>
            <p>air. When I <del>looked</del><metamark>^</metamark><add>look</add> at him </p>

            <p>– a dove that circles the </p>
            <p>cleft. To hear this challenge, </p>
            <p>to see it thrown down to us </p>
            <p>before an European assembly, </p>
            <p>&amp; the princes &amp; rulers of the </p>
            <p>Universal Church – it </p>
            <p>magnifies us almost un-</p>
            <p>-bearably. And Vincent continues </p>
            <p>that perhaps it is impossible </p>
            <p>– as Epic &amp; Drama dwell </p>
            <p>together in the inspired Gospels. </p>
            <p>Lyric poetry has laid a great </p>

            <p>“Then it was the five shilling </p>

            <p>He laughs . . . O <unclear>Trajan</unclear>! He </p>

            <p>I came in to receive the Prior’s </p>
            <p>last hour of the morning. He is </p>
            <p>a shade weary, &amp;, I think, after </p>
            <p>my sad, intimate Confession of </p>
            <p>the previous visit, less expansive – </p>
            <p>the sort of freemasonry of virtue </p>
            <p>lost between us . . . It may be </p>
            <p>only retributive imagining. </p>
            <p>I cannot remember much </p>

            <p>round the Catholic Faith &amp; Beauty</p>
            <p> – on the pivot of Gosscommon’s </p>
            <p>one word of his terror “Form” . . . . . . </p>
            <p>How Vincent bent down into his </p>
            <p>white eagle’s plumage &amp; laughed </p>
            <p>– a little “discoruskinortably”. Then </p>
            <p>he spoke of Beauty as one of God’s </p>
            <p>eternal attributes, that man </p>
            <p>could abuse when he severed it </p>
            <p>from what was divine. The severe </p>

            <p>a religious expression, &amp; at the </p>
            <p>Renaissance the world fell into </p>
            <p>double error – the error of withdrawing </p>
            <p>beauty from religion; the error </p>
            <p>of founding it on the irreligious </p>
            <p>&amp; already degraded art of </p>
            <p>Classic Rome. I spoke of the </p>
            <p>infamous sins of the Jesuits </p>
            <p>against beauty – but they had </p>
            <p>taken the debased Renaissance </p>
            <p>art &amp; tried to apply it to Christian </p>
            <p>edification, a certain failure – </p>
            <p>for they only copied the Renaissance</p>

            <p>We spoke of disciples &amp; I said </p>

            <p>supernatural character <unclear>most</unclear></p>
            <p>triumphantly in this. Yes, </p>
            <p>Christ’s disciples are as </p>
            <p>the disciples of no other </p>
            <p>from the foundations of the </p>
            <p>world. Vincent is struck </p>
            <p>&amp; kindled by the thought, he </p>
            <p>has never thought.</p>
            <p>Vincent also says how the Church </p>

            <p>He died on the Cross.</p>
            <p>And the Eucharist allies itself </p>
            <p>with the elements of man’s </p>
            <p>natural life – the wheat, the loaf – </p>
            <p>the grape, the red wine – the </p>

            <p>things of vital beauty.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Vincent’s face had a frenzied </p>
            <p>dismay at the thought of the </p>
            <p>Crucifix. Once he fell, limp, over </p>
            <p>his hands on the Table. </p>

            <p> – I am trying to cure myself of the deep-</p>

            <p>tea.</p>
            <p> It produces faith, &amp; courage, &amp; the prophetic </p>

            <p>on Oct. 12, a Monday – we have </p>

            <p>Now the Office is become </p>
            <p>sweet as the winning of Daily </p>
            <p>Bread, &amp; we feel superannuated, </p>
            <p>like retired bread-winners, if </p>
            <p>we have been so industrious as </p>
            <p>to leave nothing to do after </p>
            <p>breakfast.</p>
            <p>With the Office one leads the inner </p>
            <p>life of the Church, even of the </p>
            <p>Holy Mass itself. When I asked </p>
            <p>my Confessor if I should do any </p>
            <p>devotion for Advent, he said </p>
            <p>no – if I did the Office “digne, </p>
            <p><del>devote &amp;</del> attente ac devote” it </p>
            <p>simply did away with any </p>
            <p>other devotion. “They are all very </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>On the Sat. after my return, I told </p>

            <p>I took as the bitterest humiliation </p>
            <p>&amp; punishment due to my actual </p>
            <p>mortal sin – but that he could </p>
            <p>so distrust me as to think such </p>
            <p>a thing had been unconfessed </p>
            <p>after my Reception of daily </p>
            <p>Communion for nearly a year &amp; </p>
            <p>after my solemn Confirmation. </p>
            <p>His self-control was admirable </p>
            <p>– with slightly incoherent </p>
            <p>persuasion, he <unclear>assured</unclear> me </p>
            <p>he had only put a question </p>
            <p>as Confessors often had to </p>
            <p>do to Converts – they being so </p>
            <p>hazy as to the <metamark>^</metamark><add>needful</add> matter of </p>
            <p>Confession. He ignored my </p>
            <p>reply that no one who confessed </p>
            <p>at all could imagine such </p>
            <p>a sin not a matter of Confession, &amp;</p>
            <p>proved his case to his satisfaction </p>
            <p>by telling me that had he </p>
            <p>thought I was “receiving </p>
            <p>unworthily” he would have </p>
            <p>spoken at once – “See?”. </p>
            <p>I let him have his head &amp; </p>
            <p>murmured <hi rend="underline">Yes</hi>. </p>
            <p>I am glad I spoke : he has been </p>
            <p>most honouringly careful in </p>
            <p>every possible way since. He </p>
            <p>had allowed himself to be led </p>
            <p>too far by his (true) conviction, </p>
            <p>clairvoyantly certain, that I </p>

            <p>back. He had settled in his obstinate </p>
            <p>head what my sin was – I gave </p>
            <p>him a new opportunity by speaking </p>
            <p>of the past &amp; of those I moved among – </p>
            <p>Before he came to the Confessional </p>
            <p>he prayed before the altar </p>
            <p>desperately – in the Confessional </p>
            <p>he tried to force Confession, </p>
            <p>like an inquisitor or a </p>
            <p>Council for the prosecution – </p>
            <p>He showed the strong Confessor’s </p>
            <p>power of driving into a corner. </p>
            <p>Had I sinned so, I must have </p>
            <p>confessed it, under his pressure </p>
            <p>&amp; under his appeal.</p>
            <p>But he went very far in zeal </p>
            <p>– &amp; I have suffered a great penance. </p>
            <p>I am glad he has suffered himself </p>

            <p>When Michael said he was </p>
            <p>really responsible for the case </p>
            <p>the colour rushed down his </p>

            <p>Obstinately, silently he has </p>
            <p>hoped on.</p>
            <p>Another time, at tea, Michael </p>

            <p>“Oh, if it must be, it must be!”</p>
            <p>– but his eyes were his Master’s </p>

            <p>young man; they were almost </p>
            <p>omnipotent. I have described </p>

            <p>I have not got the money – all </p>

            <p>I speak of Charity – the preciousness </p>

            <p>I have been most rigorously treated by </p>
