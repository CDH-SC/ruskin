<salute>Dear Mr. Carlyle</salute></opener>
<p>I am some thoughts of making a true <hi rend="italic">foray</hi> upon you this evening&#8212;having been rendered desperate by Woolner&#8217;s telling me that it was <hi rend="italic">three years</hi> since I had seen you. &#8212;but this morning it looks so much as if&#8212;could I once get to Chelsea&#8212;you might have some difficulty in getting quit of me again till a thaw came&#8212;that I will not venture&#8212;. Only I warn you that I really must come &#38; see you one of these days, if you won&#8217;t come &#38; <hi rend="italic">see us</hi>.</p>
<p>People are continually accusing me of borrowing other men&#8217;s thoughts, &#38; not confessing the obligation. I don&#8217;t think there is anything of which &#8216;I am more utterly incapable than of this meanness&#8212;but it is very difficult always to know how much one is I debted to other people&#8212;and it is always most difficult to explain to others the degree in which a stronger mind may guide you&#8212;without having at least intentionally, borrowed this or the other definite thought. The fact is, it is very possible for two people to hit <hi rend="italic">sometimes</hi> on the same thought&#8212;and I have over and over again been somewhat vexed as well as surprised at finding that what I really <hi rend="italic">had</hi> and <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> I had, worked out for myself, corresponded very closely to things that you had said much better. I entreat you not to think when (if you have ever patience to do so) you glance at anything I write, and when you come as must sometimes, on bits that look like bits of yourself spoiled, &#8212;to think that I have been mean enough to borrow from you knowingly, &#38; without acknowledgment. How much your general influence has told upon me, I know not&#8212;but I always confess it&#8212;or rather boast of it, in conversation about you and you will see what&#8212;considering the way malicious people <hi rend="italic">catch</hi> at such confessions, is certainly a very frank one&#8212;at the close of the lecture of which I send you a Builder containing a report. I have marked the passage, p. 639.</p>
<closer><salute>&#8212;with sincere regards to Mrs. Carlyle, believe me, my dear Sir,
<lb/>Most faithfully Yours,</salute>

<p>Not that I have not been busy&#8212;and very busy, too. I have written, since May, good six hundred pages, had them rewritten, cut up, corrected, and got fairly ready for the press&#8212;and am going to press with the first of them on Gunpowder Plot day, with a great hope of disturbing the Public Peace in various directions. Also, I have prepared about thirty drawings for engravers this year, retouched the engravings (generally the worst part of the business), and etched some on steel myself. In the course of the six hundred pages have had various remarks on German Metaphysics, on Poetry, Political Economy, Cookery, Music, Geology, Dress, Agriculture, Horticulture, and Navigation, all of which subjects I have had to &#8220;read up&#8221; accordingly, and this takes time. Moreover, I have had my class of workmen out sketching every week in the fields during the summer;and have been studying Spanish proverbs with my father&#8217;s partner, who came over from Spain to see the Great Exhibition. I have also designed and drawn a window for the Museum at Oxford; and have every now and then had to look over a parcel of five or six new designs for fronts and backs to the said Museum.</p>
<p>During my above-mentioned studies of horticulture, I became dissatisfied with the Linnaean, Jussieuan, and Everybody-elseian arrangement of plants, and have accordingly arranged a system of my own; and unbound my botanical book, and rebound it in brighter green, with all the pages through-other, and backside foremost&#8212;so as to cut off all the old paging numerals; and am now printing my new arrangement in a legible manner, on interleaved foolscap. I consider this arrangement one of my great achievements of the year. My studies of political economy have induced me to think also that nobody knows anything about that; and I am at present engaged in an investigation, on independent principles, of the natures of money, rent, and taxes, in an abstract form, which sometimes keeps awake all night. My studies of German metaphysics have also induced me to think that the Germans don&#8217;t know anything about <hi rend="italic">them</hi>; and to engage in a serious enquiry into the meaning of Bunsen&#8217;s great sentence in the beginning of the second volume of the &#8220;Hippolytus,&#8221; about the Finite realization of infinity; which has given me some trouble.</p>
<p>The course of my studies of Navigation necessitated my going to Deal to look at the Deal boats; and those of geology to rearrange all my minerals (and wash a good many, which, I am sorry to say, I found wanted it). I have also several pupils, far and near, in the art of illumination; an American young lady to direct in the purchase of Turners, &#8212;and various little bye things besides. But I am coming to see you.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. Carlyle</salute></opener>
<p>I <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> everything to be arranged as you wish it&#8212;or rather as you think best&#8212;for as you wish in all respects I fear it can never be. I hope however that the first &#163;10 will not be lost as I gave it not to the old lady to buy horses with&#8212;or &#8220;let a coach be called&#8221;&#8212;but to Miss Erdman&#8212;on the understanding that there was a difficulty in the Washing department&#8212;pitiful to hear of in an old ladies house-which said sum might do away with&#8212;as I hope it has. For the rest&#8212;every autumn at fuel time&#8212;my 5 pounds shall be ready, and you shall dispose of them in whatever way you think best&#8212;and may inform the public of the same in any manner most calculated to impress them with the propriety of Subscription&#8212;I had a happy too short evening the other day. Coming again, soon. Ever affectionately Your Serv<sup>t</sup> Carlyles</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>I like this little composition very much, but it isn&#8217;t quite right &#8212;nor can I suggest what would put it right &#8212; I can only do as you bid me, &#38; mention the little things which seem to me wrong.</p>
<list><p><item>1st. Books too visible got up for colours sake &#8212;&#38; too much in Harlequinad squares. Books should always be grave in colour, especially books behind the head of a historian&#8217;s wife. Everybody would want to know what you <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have been reading.</item></p>
<p><item>2. The masses of red in shawl a little too equal in weight, &#38; buff corners of bookcase ditto.</item></p>
<p><item>3. Too much instance [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] on slender waist.</item></p>
<p><item>4. Angle here very awkward. Three lines should never meet in this way.</item></p>
<p><item>5. People will say that Mrs. Carlyle is indolent.</item></p>
<p><item>Bar of bookcase horizontal above head too conspicuous. &#8212;That&#8217;s all, I think. Nero will be delightful.</item></p></list>

<salute>Dear Mrs. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>The points to be stated in your interior-or finish [?] painter respecting his perspective are simply there. That if he stands at any point he choose in the room, and tries to get his canvas to hide from his eye all that he has drawn of it, he will find that cannot do it. He thus violates the first rule of perspective by making his point of station imaginary, or rather impossible &#8212;the perspective is only true for a point within about six inches of the picture&#8217;s surface which is at <hi rend="italic">least</hi> a foot too little. This station point should have been a foot and a half from the surface at least.</p>
<p>The second point to be noted is that even in the supposition of his point of station being possible, I believe the returning distance are not drawn to true scale. I am not <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> sure of this, but I think he has given the inner room too much recess by an inaccurate use of his measuring line. If he will cut three inches off the top and bottom of his picture however it will be very nearly right.</p>
<p>Kindest regards to Mr. Carlyle.</p>
<p>The book I sent yesterday is of no use to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and is very highly spoken of by the French themselves; but if it is only like the rest &#8212;I will take it away again when I come next. Dear Mrs. Carlyle,</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>I have had to go down into the north since I came from abroad, and have been sharply unwell since and am still confined to the house, but unless I hear from you to the contrary I shall come first evening in next week that I am well enough. &#8212;I have been nearly crushed by the badness of German painting &#38; all that it signifies of worse evil. &#8220;Vanity, the clearest Phasis of the Devil in these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8212;I think I shall have to give up painting&#8212;writing&#8212;talking everything but reading &#8212;and I read little now but Mr. Carlyle. &#8212;Fiction sickens me, because it is fiction. I am weary of it. Truth depresses me &#8212;because it is true. Not that one can find much very plainly written. And it depresses me also never to have had a line from you, thought I heard you were both on the whole well, in Scotland.</p>
<p>I trust I may find you in good truth, when I come.</p> 
<p>Ever with sincere regards to Mr. Carlyle.</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>I am so very glad you liked the things &#38; especially the flowers &#8212;for indeed the Melancholy is not exactly likeable. What it means &#8212;no one <hi rend="italic">knows</hi>. &#8220;Cavernous meaning&#8221; is just the word for it.</p>
<p>In the main, it evidently means the full sense of the terror-mystery &#8212;turmoil &#8212;responsibility of the world, ending in great awe &#38; sadness &#8212;and perpetual labour &#8212; (as opposed to French legrete [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] &#8212;lightly crowned with budding hay &#8212;winged &#8212;as in true angelic service &#8212; (The Wolf hound of fiercer sorrow laid asleep at her feet.) Strong bodied. Having the Keys of all knowledge. Compare Tennyson&#8217;s &#8212;</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>This weather hardly lets one manage one&#8217;s pen; much less one&#8217;s horse: We never hoped for you on Sunday: I am only sorry you had the trouble of writing about it: &#8212;don&#8217;t do so any more &#8212;I only want you to come precisely when you are in the way &#38; the liking thereof. I am always at home by dinner on Sunday, at latest; my father generally all day: of course till the frost ends we have no hope: But I can&#8217;t come but at nights either in this bitter weather &#8212;at least unless it drives one to extremities. I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> come, somewhere about Tuesday or Wednesday to wish you happy New Year. I&#8217;m going to make Christmas &#38; New Year&#8217;s presents of &#8220;Past and Present&#8221; chiefly. I find everything that has to be said on any matter is all in that, and other people may forever hold their Peace. (I&#8217;ll hold mine; &#8212;if I can get a little to hold.) My hands are too cold to write. Love to Mrs. Carlyle. Ever devotedly Yours,</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>I was <hi rend="italic">so</hi> glad to get Froude&#8217;s letter, with your little endorsement and I would have set to work instantly, but you can&#8217;t think how ill I am; indeed I&#8217;ve not been able to do a sentence of anything all this summer. The heaviest depression is upon me I have ever gone through; the great questions about Nature and God and man have come on me in forms so strange and frightful &#8212;and it is so new to me to do everything expecting only Death, though I see it is the right way &#8212;even to play &#8212; &#38; <hi rend="italic">men</hi> who are men, nearly always do it without talking about it.</p>
<p>But all my thoughts and ways are overturned &#8212;so is my health for the present &#8212;and I can do nothing this year.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll write to you and to Mrs. Carlyle from Ireland where I&#8217;m going today &#8212;wind and weather serving.</p>
<p>I have written to Mr. Froude by this post and I am ever your &#38; Mrs. Carlyle&#8217;s affectionate servant &#8212; (thought you have Charlotte too).</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle</salute></opener>
<p>Two days before hearing from my father of Mr. Carlyle&#8217;s kind little visit I had sent an underlined charge of gravest character, to let me know how you both were. I should have written myself, but was for a month after leaving home this last time, in a state of stupid depression which there was no use in giving any account of. I am now settled here, with a bright room &#8212;fire &#8212;and view of lake. I draw and paint a little every day &#8212;very little, but what I do is now accumulative and I hope will come to something. I am gaining strength gradually; &#8212;and learning some Latin &#38; Greek. I do everything as quietly and mechanically as I can. I have little pleasure &#8212;and no pain &#8212;except toothache sometimes. I forget, resovedly, all that human beings are doing of ridiculous, or suffering of its consequences; try to regret nothing &#8212;and to wish for nothing. I am obliged to pass much time in mere quiet &#8212;and standing with one&#8217;s hand behind one&#8217;s back is tiresome &#8212;I make up my mind to be tired and stand. The nights &#8212;if one wakes in them, are sadly long &#8212;one tries to think &#8220;after all &#8212;it is life &#8212;why should one wish it shorter&#8221; &#8212;and one is thankful, in spite of such philosophy, when the clock strikes&#8212; (I wonder if one would be &#8212;or wild be &#8212;when it is a passing bell that strikes &#8212;which will be the same thing, once for all.) When I&#8217;ve read Xenophon&#8217;s economist [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], and Plato&#8217;s republic and one or two more things carefully, I shall finish &#8212;if I can &#8212;my political economy &#8212;of other plans, or hopes, I have none for the present. These is enough, and a great deal too much of myself. Mr. Carlyle will be angry with me for not going on with German, but it is impossible among Germans; the people make me &#8212; (or <hi rend="italic">would</hi> make me if I contemplated them) too angry to endure their language. Switzerland is degenerating &#8212;at least its people are &#8212;(and the lakes are not so clear as they used to be) &#8212; The Peasantry seem still nearly what they were &#8212;(that is to say, little more than two-legged cattle). The townspeople imitate and hate the French, having neither dignity enough to stand on their own ground, nor beauty or modesty enough to respect these they borrow from. By rifle practice, and much drinking, and making disgusting noises in the street at night, they are preparing themselves against French invasion. But what of silent and worthy is yet among them I do not see, and have no business to abuse them in general terms.</p>
<p>&#8212;I hope to get home before Christmas: but will write again as soon as I know about time. It would be a great delight to me if Mrs. Carlyle would send me just the merest line to Schweizer Hof, Lucerne, saying how you are both &#8212;&#38; that you still believe me to be affectionately yours,</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>Indeed I was just going to write again, and did not expect any answer, for I knew you were ill, but it&#8217;s so good of you, and I&#8217;m sure it made you worse &#8212;Doing nice, good things always makes people worse. Only it&#8217;s wicked of you to teaze me so about that romantic thing &#8212;so perhaps it wouldn&#8217;t hurt you after all.</p>
<p>No, I can&#8217;t come home yet. There&#8217;s a difference I assure you &#8212;not small &#8212;between dead leaves in London Fog &#8212;and living rocks, and waters&#8212;and clouds&#8212;I never saw anything sso entirely and solemnly <hi rend="italic">divine</hi> as the calm winter days are, here&#8212;Dead &#8212;or living&#8212;calm whichever you choose to feel&#8212;or call it&#8212;Intense sunshine&#8212;the fields green, as in summer, on the slopes sunward&#8212;but sparkling with dew, frost&#8212;and the white hoarfrost on their shadowy sides&#8212;mounded and mounded up and far to the pines&#8212;They all lost in avenues of light&#8212;and the great Alps clear&#8212;sharp&#8212;all strength and splendour&#8212;far round the horizon&#8212;the clear streams, still unchained, ringing about the rocks and eddying into green pools&#8212;and the lake, taking all deep into its heart under the hills. It is like the loveliest summer&#8217;s morning at five o&#8217;clock&#8212;all day long. Then in ordinary weather, the colour of the beech woods and pine on the cliffs&#8212;and of the rocks in the midst of the frost clouds! &#8212;I never saw such things&#8212;didn&#8217;t know what winter was made or meant for, before&#8212;I walked through the Reuss the day before yesterday, just for delight in its clear green water&#8212;not many people can say they&#8217;ve done that, for it is the fourth river of the Alps (Rhine&#8212;Rhone&#8212;Aar&#8212;Reuss): and it would have given a good account of me if I had tried it in the summer time&#8212;even as it was, it ran like a mill race in the middle, and needed steady walking. No&#8212;Ican&#8217;t come home yet&#8212;must manage it by New Year&#8217;s Day, thought, I believe. &#8212;Yes, it is quite true that I not only don&#8217;t know that people care for me, but never can believe it somehow. I know I shouldn&#8217;t care for myself if I were anybody else. &#8212;Yes, we&#8217;ll bring home a Lion&#8212;and I think we shall have some satisfaction in looking at it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just away to-morrow deeper into the Alps, to Altorf [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]&#8212;to see how the grimmest of them look in the snow. I&#8217;m better than I was, a good deal. &#8212;Still very sulky&#8212;and reading Latin Greek, or rather beginning to learn them&#8212;but a little comforted in feeling that I am really learning <hi rend="italic">something</hi> and in the entire peace&#8212;and rest&#8212;and being able to swear at people and know they&#8217;re out of hearing.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more cracking of whips and barking of dogs than I like&#8212;than Slender would have liked, and there are no Ann Pages. The Swiss are frightfully ugly&#8212;but when I get tired of it, I can always get away into the pine woods&#8212;where it is quiet as the night&#8212;or row into the middle of the lake&#8212;where there is often not a ripple. It would be good for both of you to come here to finish Frederick&#8212;you would have no influenza&#8212;and Mr. Carlyle might enjoy his pipe in peace.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll write again from among the deeper Alps. &#8212;Mind &#38; get the head &#38; martyrs all right. &#8212;Ever affectionately Mr. C&#8217;s &#38; yours,</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>Only to wish you as happy a Christmas as anybody has any business to have. Nice peace on earth and good will to men we have preached and practiced&#8212;this many a day&#8212;have not we? But I do wish that people had feeling enough, when they want a word synonymous with beed and pudding, to use a less olemn one. My father sent me Mr. Carlyle&#8217;s love, and it came quite nicely. &#8212;I&#8217;m coming home for New Year&#8217;s Day at any rate, D.V.</p>
<p>I write you cheerful scraps, because it makes me cheerful to think of you &#8212;buit it was very cool of Mr. Carlyle to say I was leading a life &#8220;with a trace of sadness&#8221; in it. I&#8217;m entirely miserable&#8212;that&#8217;s all; but it&#8217;s all right&#8212;and believe I&#8217;m stronger than I was. &#8212;It is not muscular power that I want so much, though I&#8217;ve no large allowance of that: but the least over though&#8212;above all, the least mortification or anxiety&#8212;makes me ill so quickly that I shall have, I believe, to live the life of a monster for some years and care for nothing but grammar. If I could make a toad of myself and get into a hole in a stone, and be quiet, I think it would do me good. &#8212;My eyes &#8212;(and toads have got those too) and ears&#8212;(which asses have also)&#8212;are too much for me. &#8212;&#8220;Non veder&#8212;non sentir m(e) (sarabbe) gran ventura.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t write letters&#8212;but I love you both, and would if I could, and long ones. I&#8217;ve got the Lion, photographed&#8212;and engraved&#8212;and neither are the least like&#8212;and it doesn&#8217;t matter, for the real thing is good for nothing&#8212;like the useless &#8220;fidelity&#8221;&#8212;(query &#8220;stupidity&#8221; &#38;&#8221;obstinacy&#8221;?) which it commemorates. I&#8217;ve no patience with the Swiss, now,&#8212;nor with anybody:&#8212;myself included. Goodbye&#8212;Ever your affectionate.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>I&#8217;m sitting by a bright wood fire&#8212;which flickers on the walls of a little room about twelve feet square &#8212;somewhat stiff in finger, as you may see by the try of pen above &#8212;and in limb, from a long walk in the frosty sunshine up and down along the piny [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] banks of this river of mine, the Arve, now green and clear, though in summer, &#8220;drumly&#8221; with glacier dust. The snowy mountains form an unbroken chain beyond the elevated plain, above which my own hill rises some five or six hundred feet up to my doorstep &#8212;and two thousand feet behind me. &#8212;I got into my cottage yesterday, and am congratulating myself (somewhat sadly in an under tone) on being out of the way of &#8212;Everything.</p>
<p>The month in London was mischievous to me. I got &#8220;off&#8221; my quiet work, and now my books seem a little dull to me, and the evenings long&#8212;and yet life seems to pass in nothing but dressing and undressing&#8212;going to bed and getting up again, a night older.</p>
<p>I saw Lady Ashburton in Paris for a few moments, and promised to write to you, and did not&#8212;having no hope to give you, and thinking that you might as well be anxious as hopeless.</p>
<p>I then travelled on through the night and came in the grey of dawn to the roots of the Alps. While, I see by the papers, there were dreadful gales in England, a keen, but healthy north wind was breaking the Lake of Genova into chequers of white and blue&#8212;dark blue&#8212;far laid under the rosy snows of Jura. Now it is quite calm, with clearest light, and soft mists among the pinewoods at morning.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading Latter days again&#8212;chiefly &#8220;Jesuitism.&#8221; I can&#8217;t thin what Mr. Carlyle wants me to write anything more for&#8212;if people don&#8217;t attend to that, what more is to be said? I feel very lazy, and think&#8212;in fact, I&#8217;m sure&#8212;that after February I shan&#8217;t write anything more till Autumn again. I can&#8217;t correct press in Spring time.</p>
<p>I wish you both a happy New year with all my heart.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. &#38; Mrs. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>I mean Mrs., particularly, but I wish you both all feasible happiness, this New Year. But Mrs. Carlyle, I want you to be very kind and good, and to show that little miniature you did when you were 14 to a friend of mine&#8212;a wise, intelligent, energetic, schoolmistress, of a girls school, where I go sometimes when I want to be&#8212;whatever you call it&#8212;flattered&#8212;or petted&#8212;or what not&#8212;But I&#8217;ve been much too sulky to stand petting this long while, and haven&#8217;t been there, and have left all my pupils at a stand still&#8212;But I want Miss Bell, and one of the girl governesses, if she can come too, to call on you, and to see that miniature, that it may show them what a child of 14 can do, when she&#8217;s going to be a Mrs. Carlyle. And if you like them, I wish you would ask them to tea. You couldn&#8217;t give a greater pleasure to two more deserving people, and you would give some to a very undeserving one, in Savoy. But this woman, Miss Bell&#8212;educated her two brothers&#8212;and they went, like idiots for missionaries, and died, and she got the world to fight with by herself now&#8212;and does it nobly, and her school is thoroughly useful and nice. She talks perhaps a little too much generally&#8212;but won&#8217;t with you, and its never nonsense.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a little better&#8212;This weather marvelous for beauty and silence&#8212;no calm like winter calm. I was up 4,000ft. above sea today, in deep snow, and was quite too hot when I got down again.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>The fine weather has really come at last, it seems, and I may claim your promise&#8212;I cannot tell you how much pleasure your letter gave me. Will you send me a single line to say when I may come and make prey of you. I should have done so months ago, only one does not like to be so importunate as to take the last excuse for staying at home out of the mouth of a reverted friend&#8212;or I should have taken that of <hi rend="italic">the distance</hi> out of yours, long ago.</p>
<p>&#8212;Any day next week&#8212;perhaps you had better give me choice of two, in case of any inevitableness turning itself up meanwhile&#8212;at your own time, I will come &#38; carry you &#38; Mrs. Carlyle off&#8212;Truly&#8212;our place here looks green &#38; the hay is deep&#8212;and we are on the whole at our best. With sincerest regards to Mrs. Carlyle&#8212;believe me most faithfully and gratefully Yours,</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Carlyle,&#8212;You will not think it was out of thoughtlessness or disrespect that I have not written to you. You had enough sorrow of your own, and could by no means help us in ours. To-day I have a note from Lady Trevelyan saying Mrs. Carlyle is much better&#8212;this gives me courage to ask for you both. My mother and I are in all practical and necessary ways able for what has come upon us. <hi rend="italic">She</hi> is very wonderful to me; I have little doubt but that I may yet, if I am spared, procure her some years of no false or slight, but peaceful and hopeful, <hi rend="italic">happiness</hi>.</p>

<p>Indeed it is long, but I have just done a little bit of work which needed me to keep quietly at it: and I was ill in the middle of it which threw all back.</p>
<p>And I thought Mr. Carlyle would have enough to do, &#38; be bothered:&#8212;and now it is all right, and I hope to bring him my bit of a book on Saturday, if I may come.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p><hi rend="italic">Pray</hi> come &#8212;as you kindly think of doing, and let us have talks, and looks. Geology is just in its most interesting stage of youth&#8212;a little presumptuous, but full of strength and advancing life. Its general principles and primary facts are now as certain as those of astronomy, but of &#8212;Central fire we as yet know nothing. You shall look at stones, and give them a <hi rend="italic">time</hi>, and see what will come out of them for you, in your own way. I know you will find them interesting. But all the books are dismal, yet full of good work. I will stay in any day for you after Friday. You are sure to catch me before I go out any day, if you are as early as one. &#8212;Ever your affecte,</p>

<postscript><p>I wish you would read the tenth chapter, especially pp.112&#8211;113, in the book of Lyell&#8217;s which I send, with some care. The facts are those closest to us, and they are distinct, and very wonderful. If one once understands the relation of the formations of such an island as Ischia to the existing Fauna, all the after steps of geology are thereby measurable.</p></postscript></closer>

<salute>Dear Mrs. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>Am I not glad to hear!&#8212;even though it is of such pain and though I have the sorrow of knowing you wrote all that with your lame hand. After those last flowers, I went to Winnington where one of the younger governesses was ill of decline, she&#8217;s now dying &#8212;And I never saw an entirely healthy and happy girl burned away like a wax candle before &#8212;so it gave me some thoughts, &#38; left the others less time, and her sister less heart for their work, and the school was just at its busiest time so I stayed a day or two longer and gave them some talks by way of such help as I could; so when I came back in a fortnight my mother &#38; I concocted a visit to you &#8212;and we got up really a nice flower, and away we went to Chelsea my mother so particular about her two cards! one to be for Mr. Carlyle&#8217;s mythic presence. So when we got there they said you were in Scotland, but couldn&#8217;t tell me where, or I should have written long ago.</p>
<p>Please come back and don&#8217;t go to Folkstone [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. I&#8217;ve found a doctor here who will make you well if anybody will, for he&#8217;s so good to this poor girl and has helped her in all sorts of out of the way illness, that made the lungs worse.</p>
<p>&#8212;I&#8217;ve had one letter from lady Trevelyan &#8212;she&#8217;s better, and soon coming home. I have not answered it. I can&#8217;t talk&#8212;I&#8217;ve no ideas. &#8212;&#38; I never seemed to have much interrupting business &#8212;it drives me wild not to be able to go on with my life for perpetual &#8220;musts&#8221; &#8212;and I don&#8217;t know what I shall come to, but I can&#8217;t write for I&#8217;m always in bad humour. I&#8217;ll see about this friend of yours however. I wrote her last night. I don&#8217;t remember any Mrs. Hawkes. I remember Miss Jewsbury. My mother is not well&#8212;nervous and dreamy&#8212;I am a little anxious&#8212;but hope it&#8217;s only stomach.</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>I am so happy about the birthday,&#8212;and very proudly happy that I can give you pleasure on any day. My mother is very cock-ahoop too, about your pretty message, but that is good for her, for she&#8217;s always snubbing <hi rend="italic">me</hi> and then I say impertinent things to her, which she pretends not to mind, but does; and while she is always <hi rend="italic">saying</hi> things which look as if she was the most conceited person in the world, she is really very uncomfortably humble, and glad of a bit of nice praise like this of yours.</p>
<p>I wrote &#8220;lame hand&#8221; carelessly, but I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> read your letter. I meant the cramp-taking hand, not the disabled one.</p>
<p>But you must get the hands into order, we can&#8217;t have strikes right &#38; left like this.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to draw flowers, and feel as if I was a cramp altogether like Stefano [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. But unremissedly in affection and duty to you always your, </p>

<p>It breaks my heart to get such a letter from you, yet it is quite like you&#8212; very monumental of you&#8212; Only how could you think I did not understand your emphasis&#8212; I know how you feel things, and that what you were feeling was right, though you had not had time to see other things in the picture. What is that between thee &#38; me?&#8212; Well, of course I&#8217;ll come; but could not Mrs. Carlyle and you come here.&#8212; You see, if I ask you to dinner my mother will make a state-matter of it&#8212;and fatigue herself with thinking of all dishes on and out of the earth&#8212; If you will come earlier, &#38; stay dinner by surprise good; but I think the best way would be to drive over her about &#189; past six, to tea, &#38; for chat in evening. Could you do this&#8212; would you like it? Then I&#8217;ll come for another goodbye chat&#8212;at Chelsea&#8212;Any day would do for us except tomorrow?</p>

<p>Could Mr. Carlyle and you dine with us on Tuesday? I could not ask you before, because I want you to see the child who was ill, (as I told you in posing up to photographers the other day), and I was not sure if she would be able to come, but she&#8217;s well now again and she&#8217;s coming with her other unless she gets ill again. So please come both, if you can. Just let me have one line by Crawly, if possible saying if you can come. (&#189; past 6).</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>I went to Waterloo Place and gave Mr. Hume that letter about Lord Russell, yesterday, and the bearer of this had already delivered his pamphlet to him today. I asked him also whether he might not be helped in his present work by the lawyer&#8217;s precision of my friend Mr. Pattison&#8212;(I heedlessly called him Harrison to you the other night&#8212;having another lawyer and politico-economist friend of that name). But Mr. Hume looked a little disconcerted at the proposal, so it is best, I suppose, at present to leave matters in his very willing and active hands.  I spoke to him about the Price matters; your kind note being, for the rest, quite enough for me; &#8212;however, I spoke to Hume about it, and he read me Eyre&#8217;s own letter about Price&#8212;which is conclusive.</p>
<p>The reason I attached overdue weight to Price&#8217;s letter you might partly guess from his niece&#8217;s, which I left with you, not inadvertently. I do not know if you looked at it again or thought of it in any wise&#8212;but if you could be troubled to glance over this two-in-one letter enclosed, which you see bears (receptive) postmark, &#8220;Luzern, 28th Nov., 1861,&#8221; you will see how it is that I can&#8217;t work now so well as I used to do; and why you must not scold me for not always being able to &#8220;look valiantly upon these things.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seems to be that a magnificent <hi rend="italic">closing</hi> work for you to do would be to set your finger on the turning points and barriers in European history&#8212;to gather them into trains of light&#8212;to give, without troubling yourself about detail of proof, your own <hi rend="italic">final</hi> impression of courses and causes of things&#8212;and your thoughts of the leading men, <hi rend="italic">who</hi> they were, and <hi rend="italic">what</hi> they were. If you like to do this, I&#8217;ll come and <hi rend="italic">write</hi> for you a piece of every day, if after beginning it, you still found the mere hand work troublesome.

<salute>Dear Mr. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>I fear you have been expecting me. I have been expecting myself&#8212;every evening, but cold &#38; hoarseness came after the toothache, &#38; now I can&#8217;t speak.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll come as soon as I can&#8212;I want so much to speak to you about that precious writing of yours, about old days. I had not courage when you did me the grace to speak of it, to say what I wanted to say. I must try, next time I come.</p>

<salute>Dearest Mr. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>I should indeed have written to you, as you bade me&#8212;long ago, if it had not been that I had nothing to say except either what you knew very well&#8212;(that I loved you&#8212;and because I did, was glad, for the time, I had lost you)&#8212;or&#8212;what it would have made you very angry with me to know. Which, as it must be told, may well now be at once got confessed. Namely, that one day&#8212;soon after you left&#8212;I sat down gravely to consider what I could say about poetry, and finding after a forenoon that the sum of my labours amounted to four sentences, with the matter of two in them, that also my hands were hot&#8212;and my lips parched&#8212;and my heart heavy&#8212;I concluded that it was not the purpose of fate that I should lose any more days in such a manner, and wrote to the Oxford people a final and formal farewell.</p>
<p>For which they have graciously expressed pretty regrets: but I have since felt none&#8212;except those which related to the letter I had some day to write to Mentone.</p>
<p>One pleasant thing I had to tell you of, however, was a most happy evening we had with your sister. I think she enjoyed it too. My mother was entirely happy with her at once, and my cousin rejoiced in her, and I rejoiced in all three. Her modest gentleness of <hi rend="italic">power</hi> is notable to me above anything I have yet seen of womankind.</p>
<p>She saved a little bit of Frederick the Great from the housemaid&#8212;and sent it me&#8212;for which I am ever her grateful servant.</p>
<p>She told me a little thing that touched me closely also&#8212;that you had thought it worth while to keep&#8212;labelled&#8212;that little scrawl of curved lines I made one evening. And I think I shall be able to show you, when you return, that my poor little gift, such as it is, <hi rend="italic">does</hi> lie in eye and hand&#8212;not in brains&#8212;for, since I finally gave up the Oxford matter, I set myself (chiefly to put some too painful thoughts from me) to do in painting one or two little things as well as I could. (Which I never did before&#8212;for all my drawing hitherto has only been to collect data&#8212;never for its own sake.) And, doing as well as I could, I have done&#8212;not ill&#8212;several things&#8212;a dead partridge, and a wild drake, and a small twisted shell. That sounds despicable enough, I fear, to you in your olive woods at the feet of Witches of Endor;&#8212;nevertheless, poor as it may be, I think it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> my work. For, Turner being dead, I am quite sure there is no one else in England now who could have painted that shell, but I; and it seems to me, therefore, I must have been meant to do it.</p>
<p>I need not say how happy the kind sentence about your wishing to have me again on Wednesday evenings made me. Nevertheless, I must still unselfishly pray that you may be enchanted away by magical &#8220;hair of the head&#8221;&#8212;to Florence at least, if not to Rome. That satiety of travel is surely a kind of lichenous overgrowing of one&#8217;s thoughts when one has been <hi rend="italic">too</hi> long at rest&#8212;very good for most people, if they would only have patience to take the colouring&#8212;but surely not for you? I think your interest in seeing would increase the more you were tempted to see, and that the mere change of air and of slope of sunray, by whatever endurance of irksome motion obtained, would be&#8212;of&#8212;so much better for you than the monotonous effluvium of Chelsea shore. The fog was so dark to-day that I had candles at nine o&#8217;clock breakfast. Think of that! and look up to your sky &#8220;with recognition.&#8221;</p>
<p>My mother thanks you much for your good message. I hope to have some interesting little gossip to write to you about my cousin, next week.</p>
<p>I am so ashamed of my writing. I can&#8217;t help it, unless I write so very slow that I should forget what I had to say. Sincere regards to Lady Ashburton.&#8212;Ever your affectionate</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>I have had a heavy time of it since I wrote last, in various ways of which I cannot tell you; not that there is anything in my mind which I would not trust you to know, but because there are some conditions of trouble for which one has no business to ask sympathy even from one&#8217;s dearest friends. I am now recovering some dim tranquility and writing a few letters on political econ., which I hope you will say it was better to write than not,&#8212;though I am too unwell to take pains with them: and the entirely frightful and ghastly series of unnatural storm and frost which lasted through the beginning of this month (far into it, indeed), followed by severe March blights and bleak swirlings of bitter rain, has kept me from any wholesome walking or breathing until I can hardly think or stand.</p>
<p>(4th April) And now I do not know if it is of the least use to send this to Mentone; but I will let it take its chance&#8212;the main thing that I wanted to say to you being that I have had to meditate somewhat closely over educational questions lately, and I am more than ever impressed with the sense of the greatness of the gift you could bestow in the good close of all your labour by a summary of your present vision of history, and of its causative forces: not writing the history of any country, but marking the conclusions to which you had come in reading its history yourself; and telling us the events that were of essential significance; &#38; separating them in their true relations, from things useless.</p>
<p>Suppose I were to ask you, for instance, briefly (not being able to read for myself any history of Spain)&#8212;what had made the Spaniard of today what he is? You would sit down in your fender-corner, and roll me out an entirely clear and round statement of the main dealings of Providence and of the Devil with him&#8212;and of him with them. Now if you were to write down such an answer&#8212;of its quarter of an hour&#8217;s length&#8212;and then amplify &#38; illustrate it as you saw good, it would be a perfect guide to me, for such labour as I could undertake on the subject&#8212;but which without a guide would be wholly thrown away&#8212;so that indeed I should never undertake it.</p>
<p>Do think of this, in your rambles under the olive trees. I hope, wherever you are, that this weather has found you still in Italy, and that you will outstay the Firefly time. I always think that nothing in the world can possibly be so touching, in its own natural sweetness, and in the association with the pensive and glorious power of the scene, as the space of spring time in Italy during which the firefly makes the meadows quiver at twilight. And then if you were to get up to the lakes, in May! and go back up the Val Formazza over the Gries and Grimsel, and so to the Giesback Inn on the lake of Brientz, you would find that in early June the happiest&#8212;coolest&#8212;warmest&#8212;cosiest&#8212;wildest work! and two dear good Swiss girls would wait on you, who would remember my two little girls and me, last year&#8212;and do everything they could&#8212;&#38; they could a great deal &#8212;to make you comfortable.&#8212;And now I must say good-bye&#8212;and please forgive this nothing of a letter. I might have told you a great deal, that only would have vexed you,&#8212;nothing&#8212;is better.</p>

<salute>My Dear Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>I deeply regret, for many not trivial reasons, that you have been induced to write this letter.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the only thing which now in justice remains for you to do, is to furnish me with a succinct statement of what you remember yourself to have said on the occasion in question; and to permit me to substitute that statement, in the edition of collected letters, for the one which has offended you. In any case I shall take no notice of the letter in the Pallmall Gazette, nor of any comments which may be made upon it.</p>

<p>I am under the sorrowful necessity of ignoring your present letter. You have given the lie publicly, and in the most insulting terms possible to you, to the man who probably of all men living, most honoured you. It is <hi rend="italic">first because</hi> he so honours you but <hi rend="strikethrough">also</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] for many reasons besides&#8212;(and, as I said&#8212;none of them trivial) that he is compelled to require you to do right in this matter; and the right manifestly is that you either justify the terms of that letter in the Pallmall Gazette, or retract them, and that publicly; and with all convenient speed.</p>

<p>Dear Carlyle&#8212;I am fearfully sorry about this thing: more fatal and feminine incontinence never yet ruined cause than this of yours.&#8212;All the Edinburgh Professors and English fools that live, bellowing with one accord in at my window, would not have made <hi rend="italic">me</hi> write such words of a man who was my friend!&#8212;or of anything which could be indirectly traced or attributed to him.

<p>I cannot write the formal letter today, any more than I could yesterday, being variously occupied out in the sun:&#8212;but I more &#38; more wonder at your not being able to distinguish between your lava-current of a mind&#8212;tumbling hither &#38; thither and <hi rend="italic">cooling</hi> in the odd corners of it at necessary periods&#8212;and my poor little leguminously climbing-tendril of a vegetable-min&#8212;subduable and flexible by a touch&#8212;but utterly unchangeable and <hi rend="italic">implacable</hi> in its poor wounded way&#8212;and changeless of temperature. One of the things that has struck deepest into me, in this, is the heartlessness with which, when I had told you that I was fighting a batter of bitterest pain, now at the very crisis when of all things it was [necessary?] that all probable honour should be done me by all who loved me, for my love&#8217;s sake&#8212;that you should have forgotten and trampled all this under foot&#8212;just because you could not bear some newpaper gabble&#8212;and written the most dishonouring words that could be set down in public sight&#8212;</p>
<p>I know you did not mean them&#8212;and that you did the whole thing frantically, But see what a deadly <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>, this phrenzy is to me, in the new reading it gives me of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> your doings&#8212;Your books have from this one thing&#8212;become at once at a tinkling cymbal to me&#8212;and whatever the commonest wretches now assert against them&#8212;I am powerless <hi rend="italic">now</hi> to deny!  What you have said of me&#8212;I know now, when the humour is on you&#8212;you would say of any one. It is the saddest thing.&#8212;</p>
<p>And I always suffer this kind of thing from those I have most cared for, and then I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> forgive, just because I know I was the last person on earth they ought to have treated so. <hi rend="italic">Turner</hi> did something of the same kind to me. I never forgave him, to his death.</p>
<p>Well, some day soon I will write the next necessary letter&#8212;you don&#8217;t seem yet to understand that I intend the correspondence to be published, if necessary. Your two present letters are irrelevant, and shall not be held part of the series, unless you chose but <hi rend="italic">after this</hi>&#8212;remember&#8212;answer, or refusal of answer, most be for possible publication.</p>

<salute>My dear Carlyle</salute></opener>
<p>I am going into Scotland for a week or two on Friday, and I want to see you before I go&#8212;if I may, without any reference to newspaper business. Don&#8217;t think there is any change in my notions respecting <hi rend="italic">them</hi>,&#8212;but between you and me, they ought not to come.</p>
<p>Only,&#8212;please understand this&#8212;I come to you, exactly as I should vome to my Father, if he were alive&#8212;and I should say,</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Father, if you are going to speak or teaze me, on such and such matters, I won&#8217;t come; I have no mind to come, merely to be scolded&#8212;still less to find fault with you. If you were not my Father, I would not come at all, but being so, and because moreover you love me, and I love you, I want to see you&#8212;but you are not to say a word on such and such matters, nor to think that I shall in any wise act differently in them because I want to see you.</p>
<p>I have a great deal to see to and shall be a little later tomorrow evening. Don&#8217;t have tea for me, but I&#8217;ll run in about nine o&#8217;clock and tell you where I&#8217;m going and anything else that I can, pleasant.</p>

<p>I just got the Frederick in time; it is so nice to have it in this manageable form. with my own marked edition safe at home I have been travelling every day since&#8212;I could not write before&#8212;nor now&#8212;for the sunshine and fresh air of the last four days have made me dull with their excess of brightness.&#8212;only just this word of thanks.</p>
<p>I have the Sartor with me <hi rend="strikethrough">too</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] also&#8212;it belongs to me now&#8212;more than any other of your books.</p>
<p>I have nearly all my clothes to make, fresh&#8212;but more shroud-shape than any other.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll write again soon.</p>
<p>I was very thankful to be with you again</p>

<p>I am at home at last&#8212;I only got your lovely letter today&#8212;it was sent to a wrong address abroad&#8212;as well as Joan&#8217;s account of all your goodness to her.</p>
<p>I will come to morrow evening if I may. I would have come to night but it is my mother&#8217;s birthday.</p>
<p>I should have written to you again and again from abroad, if all things had not been full of sadness to me&#8212;and of labour also&#8212;detaining me for this year from my happy work on your German castles. Italy is in a ghastly state of ruin and I did all I could on a few things I shall never see more.&#8212;Your German Castles will, I think, be yet long spared&#8212;but I hope to get some of them next year.</p>
<p>Just send a verbal &#8220;Yes&#8221; by the bearer if I may come to morrow.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for kind note. I am so sorry for the sleeplessness.&#8212;I cannot come on Thursday in the afternoon, but I will if I may, on Saturday.</p>
<p>I saw how wrong it was that you were disturbed that evening. You will think I never notice anything you say.&#8212;But when I came at 3 to the Croydon farm, it was inevitable too late of an accident&#8212;and last Thursday I had indeed <hi rend="italic">noticed</hi>, but mistaken, your warning &#189; past eight, and thought it was &#8220;eight,&#8221; and put myself to some inconvenience that evening to come early!</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>I cannot venture to come out in this weather: I am so hard at work that the energy of me, such as it is&#8212;all spent in the morning&#8212;leaves me obliged to lie quiet in the afternoon unless the weather is warm and fine.&#8212;but I am oftern wit you, in reality for I am reading the French Revolution again, to my mother.&#8212;It reminds her of old times, and I find more aphorism in that, at present useful to me […] lectures for Feburary&#8212;to say to the schools of England what Painting means&#8212; and may be, if done by wise creatures.</p>
<p>&#8212;Enough to tire me?</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>Partly evil weather, partly my mother&#8217;s more heavily pressing need of some evening comfort&#8212;and the equally pressing need, to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, of the unbroken morning, for what I have to prepare for very real duty at Oxford, have kept me from coming to you.</p>
<p>Might I come at &#189; past 8 tomorrow, bringing with me a good, clear-headed, clearsighted&#8212;and to you most reverent and faithful&#8212;young English Merchant:&#8212;the son of my father&#8217;s nephew&#8212;who will I think work with me with all his heart in the sphere of a gradually widening West Indian Commerce&#8212;carrying it on, as English commerce should be done. His first ship he has named the &#8220;sesame&#8221;,&#8212;she sails her first voyage early in the year. And he has no desire more earnest than that of being permitted to see your face&#8212;and hear your voice.</p>
<p>May I bring him?</p>
<p>The Woolwich lecture went well.</p>

<p>We have all been so happy with Mary that we are going to trust in your kindness so far as to keep her with us till tomorrow morning,&#8212;she wants herself to get back to you, but we all want her so much that I am going to assume your permission. I would not have done so, if I had been able to send to ask it, in time to make arrangements, but I have been hurried &#38; confused to day. &#8212;She shall be back very early after breakfast tomorrow.</p>

<p>No, I have not forgotten Chelsea. But I have been doing all I could, and falling short of all I intended to, at Oxford&#8212;(yet, it is well on the whole, hitherto) and for seven weeks, have had either cold&#8212;cough&#8212;face ache&#8212;or sore throat&#8212;to work under and talk with.</p>
<p>It has been exactly as if the devil had been let worry me all he liked, provided only he didn&#8217;t stop my speaking&#8212;for every lecture&#8212;hitherto&#8212;has been fairly well heard.&#8212;They are just going to press, at the Clarendon, and as soon as I have revised free from ludicrous misprints, I will send them you as they come from press, for I think you will be pleased by what I have got stated. There have been no reports in the least intelligible&#8212;for, as you suppose&#8212;they have not been without a plan. The Morning Post also made me say the exact reverse of what I meant.&#8212;but I&#8217;ve no chance of coming to Chelsea I fear till end of next week&#8212;my throat is sore &#38; I must stay in at nights, till the last lecture is over, on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Might I come at &#189; past 8 to see you this evening. I have been entirely helpless lately through having planned twice as much as I could do, and getting my whole plan deranged like a campaign, again and again, by successive defeats. At last the best worst is done&#8212;unless you are displeased by anything in the enclosed, pp. 105, 6. which please glance at before I come.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>I send you another, perhaps a little too long, study of Gotthelf&#8217;s&#8212;study&#8212;for it is hardly a story in any sense, but as you will see even from the first sentence, from &#8220;Je m&#8217;appelle Peter Koeser&#8221; to &#8220;quittai la cuisine&#8221; a most finished piece of Dutch painting of two persons only&#8212; &#8220;<hi rend="italic">moi</hi>, et Medeli&#8221;&#8212;the &#8220;Medeli&#8221;, like the Aenneli of the miroir, is better worth painting than most queens. The &#8220;Moi&#8221;, I think you will much enjoy; and first of all, these are some notes about the author, which will answer, better than I did, your questions of last night.</p>
<p>&#8212;I answered rashly also that I was always safe till 2. I should have said 1., though usually I am not out till 2.</p>
<p>&#8212;My day is&#8212;work at any rate till one&#8212;then, on fine days out till near 5&#8212;I dine at 5., and am <hi rend="italic">always</hi> at home all the evening, unless I go to the theatre. I go nowhere else, but to Chelsea, which is my theatre of History&#8212;&#38; Humanity.</p>
<p>On Monday next, Joanna comes home, and we shall be in bustle; and on Wednesday next, I take her to Connie, (the little lady I once brought to see you) and another sister, I hope, to the theatre,&#8212;but on all the rest of the days of next week am sure to be at home in the evening.</p>
<p>&#8212;Would you care to come with me by ourselves or with Joan only sometimes to a private box, to see anything absurd enough to be interesting? that may be played this winter?</p>
<p>My sincere regards to your wise little niece.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>I&#8217;ve been in a misery of provocation against myself ever since the note to you yesterday was sent off&#8212;for the stupidity of its wording , as if I meant Joan only to come with us, &#38; not your niece&#8212;it would be so nice for us to go altogether&#8212;only first I was thinking only of going quite by ourselves&#8212;&#38; then&#8212;I said to myself in a web of parentheses&#8212; &#8220;Joan wouldn&#8217;t perhaps be merely in the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>But even if you won&#8217;t come, I want your niece to come with me &#38; Joanna (moi et Medeli!), to see something pretty, when I hear or know of anything really pretty being played.</p>
<p>I send two daily Telegraphs with a word or two which you may care to glance at.</p>

<salute>Dear Miss Aitken,</salute></opener>
<p>I&#8217;ve been ill, and besides, looking after some love affairs for both my daughters&#8212;Lily and Joan&#8212;at once, and Oxford lectures are very difficult&#8212;and my own temper difficulter&#8212;and so&#8212;and so.&#8212; I haven&#8217;t come&#8212;I&#8217;ll soon come now.</p>
<p>The Times letter was delicious to me beyond beyond [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].</p>
<p>Dear love to your Uncle</p>

<p>I am so glad of your kind note. Lily has gone back to her moorlands; but I shall gratefully bring Joanna with me on Friday evening&#8212;if that evening would be open&#8212;though it has not been because I would not leave the two girls, but because I have only now taken breath after a very difficult piece of work at Oxford, that the year is thus so nearly ended before I again see your uncle.</p>
<p>I have more things of a more or less satisfactory nature to myself, and therefore I trust to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> also, (for I am always best pleased with what I think he is likely to like,) on hands at this moment, than for some years. I hope for a happy evening in getting his counsel about them.</p>
<p>Ever with Joanna&#8217;s love &#38; thanks.</p>

<salute>Dear Miss Aitken,</salute></opener>
<p> I was on the point of writing to say I had got a <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> private, large, comfortable box for Drury Lane Pantomine on Saturday evening.</p>
<p>Would your uncle come with us. Nobody would see him, and he would see, I believe really some fairly good fooling,&#8212;but I&#8217;m going tonight to look myself, to tell him. If he won&#8217;t come, you at least we <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have.&#8212;Of course I shall be more than glad and proud to be of any help I can to Miss Jewsberry [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].

<salute>Dear Mr. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>I don&#8217;t quite know what to say about the Pantomime. I think you might get so <hi rend="italic">very</hi> angry! and poor little Mary, who would only think it amusingly foolish, herself, might think it&#8212;as it is&#8212;wickedly foolish, if she saw you angry. You know I want you to come with us, if you can <hi rend="italic">at all</hi> enjoy a foolish thing, well done in its way in some parts. But I&#8217;m a little frightened. We will be with you at 20 minutes past six&#8212;or soon after&#8212;and will of course bring Mary home to you, if she comes alone with us, and if you will be <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, and come too, we&#8217;ll all come home to Chelsea together.</p>

<p>I am deeply thankful to have your letter on this day itself. I think the great help it gives me is not so much in the actual encouragement, great as that is,&#8212;as in the pleasure of giving you pleasure&#8212;and knowing that you accept what I am doing as the fulfilment [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] so far as in me is, of what you have taught me.</p>
<p>Also, I needed your letter much, for I am at a strain in all directions at once&#8212;and was despondent, not for cause, but by over-work, about my work; and I have nothing else to fall back upon now, and can scarcely rest.</p>
<p>So many thanks to you.&#8212;</p>

<salute>My dear Mr. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>Your loving letter greeted me returning today from Oxford. My illness indeed very nearly ended me, and left me heavy in limb and otherwise helpless for some weeks. Gradually&#8212;(people say with unusual rapidity)&#8212;my strength came back&#8212;but I cannot yet run or climb as I could before.</p>
<p>As soon as I could use my hand or head, I had to get ready for press two books at once&#8212;lectures on Sculpture, and the old Fraser&#8217;s magazine polit.econ. This last I had to read &#38; revise, &#38; the Sculpture lectures&#8212;to <hi rend="italic">think</hi> much as I finished them.&#8212;My mother was, and is still slowly declining, and liked to have me near her for a little while in the evenings&#8212;so passed, with great fear of relapse into illness, the month of August.</p>
<p>In the course of the month, a letter came to me from America. In my illness, at most feverish fit, my one saying was, &#8220;If only I could lie down in Coniston water.&#8221; The letter from America was from a friend, in need of money, to ask if I would buy his cottage by Coniston water, and a few acres of copse and rock with it. I answered, yes, without having seen the place,&#8212;sent to his lawyer&#8212;concluded the purchase&#8212;and went down early in September&#8212;like the wicked person who wouldn&#8217;t come to supper&#8212;to see my piece of ground.</p>
<p>It is a bit of steep hillside facing West&#8212;commanding from the brow of it, all Coniston lake and the mass of hills of south Cumberland.&#8212;The slope is half copse&#8212;half moor and rock&#8212;a pretty field beneath, less steep, a white two-storied cottage, and a bank of turf in front of it&#8212;, then a narrow mountain road&#8212;and on the other side of that&#8212;Naboth&#8217;s vineyard &#8212;my neighbour&#8217;s field, to the water&#8217;s edge. My neighbour will lease me enough of field and shore to build a boathouse, &#38; reach it.</p>
<p>If I could write better, I should have told you all this before, but I am ashamed to inflict my writing on my friends.</p>
<p>&#8212;From Coniston, I went on see the coast of the Antiquary at Arbroath &#8212; and then back to superintend the putting of roof on my house: No workmen could be had&#8212;and it has but begun now. I had given 5000 pounds to found a drawing Mastership at Oxford.&#8212; To set this rightly on foot, I had to prepare an entire system of elementary teaching, and am at work on the material of that&#8212;drawings and the like&#8212;still, and have just been to Oxford, and have returned much tired and send this miserable written letter to you with my love, and will come, if I may, to see you, at &#189; past 8 tomorrow evening.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr Carlyle,</salute></opener> 
<p>Your lovely letter made me very sad&#8212;in some ways happy, too, in your sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8212;You must not cease enjoying your coffee. All your work is grandly done, and it is just time for coffee, &#38; pipe, and peace. If one could do good by being unpeaceful&#8212;it would be another thing. But what&#8217;s the use of dying uselessly&#8212;Better to live uselessly, but for the joy of one&#8217;s friends.</p>
<p>I enclose a letter from Joanna to your niece. I sincerely hope you can spare her to us to-morrow. I&#8217;ve a bright Irish girl here; and the two Scotch ones will make the delightfullest trefoil possible&#8212;and I&#8217;ll do what I can to make her happy, for writing me you letter.</p>
<p>Tell her, and she will tell me, Why you call Bitzius &#8220;cruel&#8221;&#8212;he seems to me an entirely sweet and loving person.</p>

<salute>My dear Mary,</salute></opener>
<p>I was very glad of your note, as you may well think, it is so dear of your uncle wanting to see me.</p>
<p>He likes me better, does he not, to come in the forenoon? Tell me this, &#8212; (and say this letter is between you &#38; me, and he is not to see it.) I&#8217;ve sent him some books. Get him to look at the preface to Munera Pulveris, and the sentence at the end of the appendix which I think is very pretty.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve sent you a little Venetian chain, which my mother used to wear.&#42; The gold is very pure, and if you will be at the pretty pains of washing it, will I hope gleam out with Venetian light.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>I have this moment received Dr. Carlyle&#8217;s letter. I should have written to you long since, but had only horrible things to write. I am under more kindly stars, now, but have much pain &#38; doubt to bear yet.&#8212; I am to be here, arranging rooms in my new house, till the middle of October I believe, but will write again soon. This is to catch the post.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>I can&#8217;t in the least make out why you wished me to look at this enclosed letter. It seems to me out of quite one of the wooly-headiest of sheep&#8217;s heads, and by no means to be noticed in any wise&#8212;It is the sort of thing that makes me feel as if I had to fight a scarecrow stuffed with dirty cotton&#8212;that choked one with fluff if one cut it. You are too good natured to put up with such people.</p>
<p>And I was a little surprised, also, (I must speak true you know), by the book you gave, &#8212;or I should have written of it before. It is boastful and pompous&#8212;not the sort of thing I should have thought you would have been pleased with&#8212;the more as I have heard you laugh at Humboldt for an old woman, &#8212;though his little finger was thicker than thicker than this man&#8217;s loins.</p>
<p>I got down here yesterday in the evening, and a five o&#8217;clock&#8212;crossing Lancaster Sands&#8212;saw what I thought the most wonderful thunderclouds in the sunset light that I had ever seen in my life.&#8212;In five minutes more, I saw they were my own opposite snowy mountains!&#8212;I had no conception any thing so beautiful was possible, with such low elevation. I would rather have drawn that view over Lancaster bay than any I ever saw from Venice.</p>
<p>Thanks, so much, for what you told me of your grandmother and mother.</p>
<p>Happy, this northern land&#8212;in snow of lofty soul&#8212;as of sweet hillside.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been putting off writing to you till I could send you my notes on Friedrich; but I&#8217;ve got so deep into it that I can&#8217;t get it done yet awhile.&#8212;Some of your bits of small print have so much in them. One I&#8217;m going to take bodily out, and print in gold&#8212;and I think you will like that I am about, generally.</p>
<p>One great question forces itself daily on me more and more. &#8220;Throw a quilt over it.&#8221; They are beautiful last words. But why is Friedrich never, apparently, solicitous about the succeeding reign? when solicitous about his dog&#8217;s comfort?</p>
<p>I am working hard at many things. Much at old chivalresque French, which is always full of things&#8212;as you know.</p>

<salute>My Dearest Carlyle,</salute></opener>
<p>If I were in good heart, or felt happy either for you or for your poor scholar, I should write often. But my own discouragement, and my sorrow at the silence to the public which mere bodily weakness now imposes on you, still in the full strength of your intellect, prevent my ever writing with joy&#8212;&#38; practically, my own hands and eyes have generally of late been past writing, before the day was over.</p>
<p>I have not the least pleasure in my work any more, except because you and Froude and one or two other friends still care for it. One might as well talk to the March dust as to the English of today&#8212;young or old; nor can they help it, poor things&#8212;any more than the dust can;&#8212;the general dustman will deposit them I suppose, some day where something will grow on them&#8212;if some beneficient wateringpan, or Aquarius ex machina, lay them in the &#8220;mud-deluge&#8221; at rest.</p>
<p>&#8212;Besides this, the loss of my mother and my old nurse leaves me without any root, or, in the depth of the word any home, and what pleasant things I have, seem to me only a kind of museum of which I have now merely to arrange the bequest,&#8212;while, so long as I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> keep at work at all, the forms of it are too many and too heavy for my digestion (Literal)&#8212;&#38; therefore only increase, instead of relieving despondency.</p>
<p>I am very careful however about not doing too much.&#8212;If I do not write to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, think how many things I must leave undone&#8212;of duty and comfort.</p>
<p>&#8212;I have ordered two copies of the lectures to be sent to you and one to Froude. (There will be ten altogether, I hope&#8212;two a week till 28th Nov.)</p>

<p>I have sent you none of the enclosed proof before, because I thought it my highest duty to you to act in absolute independence in this case, and not to allow myself the pleasure even of obedience.</p>
<p>I to day send the sheets for press,&#8212;and, this larger portion seeming to me in fair type enough, and as it will be a month&#8217;s job, probably before I get out the book, I send you these, trusting that you will forgive what may displease you in them in the knowledge you cannot but have now securely, that I am in all things your faithful and loving servant</p>

<salute>Dear M<sup>r</sup> Ruskin</salute></opener>
<p>My uncle bids me say how very much he has been surprised and gratified about your Appendix. He says that the work is beautifully done; that you have seen into the very heart of the matter; and that he is more flattered than he can express by the trouble you have taken in this matter.</p>
<p>My uncle thinks that it would be much better to refer to the people&#8217;s edition (which is only 2/a vol., and is extremely popular) than to the little 1869 edit<sup>n</sup>. I have therefore in each case substituted the page of <hi rend="italic">it</hi> in the parenthesis for that of the one you had chosen; so that should you agree with him, and not have time to look it over, you could send the proof direct to the printer, &#8212; the numbers are perfectly correct (I have been used to doing work of the kind for him). If you in the least care for a copy of this edition, which is very pleasant to read, being in small voll. easily carried about &#38; light to hold, he would be delighted to send you one at once. If your Ms. is already in the printer&#8217;s hands, I should be so very happy to alter the numbers in the parenthesis of the proofs which are still to come.</p>

<lb/>Yours affectionately &#38; respectfully,</salute>

<p>It is a great relief to my mind that your uncle likes the Appendix. I was resolved it should be done clearly, so far before he saw it, but I was very nervous.</p>
<p>So many thanks for the beautifully made alterations. I&#8217;ve sent them straight to printers.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful thing to me, that I do not know your birthday, &#8212; that I write this evening, only because a good girl who loves you&#8212; though not so much&#8212;I hope&#8212;as I do&#8212;wrote to me of it, thinking it was as it ought to be, a festival with me always. I have been irreligious in these things and would fain have a little altar tomorrow to be wreathed with vervain&#8212;and the good girl for a pretty priestess to make a little sacred feast for me, and a&#8212;Well, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anybody else I would feast with on your birthday&#8212;because there&#8217;s no one who is so entirely thankful for it as I am.</p>

<p>I hope you will enjoy reading the enclosed letter, a little. The &#8220;extinguisher&#8221; it speaks of was a lovely one of yours, which has borne good fruit. I&#8217;ve never seen this girl, but I hope she will be one of my best helpers henceforward, and find happiness in becoming so,&#8212;instead of merely &#8220;harmless&#8221; member of society. Alas&#8212;if only one could reduce nine tenths of everybody about us to &#8220;harmlessness&#8221; what a world it would be.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m soon coming to Chelsea again. If I could but remember all you say to me, in its own words! That bit about the ordering a new world at <hi rend="italic">their</hi> shop, was so delicious.</p>

<p>Both you and Froude must know what I feel to you both. I have not written to Froude&#8212;nor called. He will know it was not in neglect.</p>
<p>&#8212;<hi rend="italic">You</hi> may well wonder&#8212;(but you have been with Froude very constantly, since, I believe?) why I have been so long from Chelsea&#8212;and even a day or two now in town without coming.</p>
<p>&#8212;Pardon me for speaking selfishly of what must seem a poor matter, after Froude&#8217;s sorrow. &#8212;But I&#8217;ve had a bad tormenting one to bear as best I could&#8212;</p>
<p>&#8212;the girl whom I&#8217;ve been so long devoted to had to come to London, very nearly dying,&#8212;at the best in great danger&#8212;half mad and half starved&#8212;(and eating nothing but everything she liked&#8212;chiefly sugar almonds I believe)&#8212;Well, she had to be forbidden food &#38; I don&#8217;t know what, and,</p>
<p>Never mind that, its so ill written. She&#8217;s been physically and gravely ill; &#8212;wanted to see Joan&#8212;and not to see me.&#8212;Joan goes and nurses her, and I let her do all she can, of course,&#8212;Joan goes and nurses her, and I let her do all she can, of course,&#8212;and the girls&#8217; getting better; but I can&#8217;t stand the Tantalus life, in London: so went down home to Coniston and have done good work there and am now going to Italy tomorrow, and shall do good work there, I trust, too.</p>
<p>I want to see you, and I can&#8217;t get into town twice, today; and I&#8217;m to dine with John Simon at Kennington at 6. Might I come to you at &#189; past four?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not ill, but I can&#8217;t master my thoughts in London; and I find the little more pain is rather good for me than bad in many ways, if I&#8217;m far enough off. I&#8217;ve done a lot of work on Frederick&#8212;do you know&#8212;I think you haven&#8217;t said enough of his Dogs. The &#8220;throw a quilt over it&#8221; at the last is so lovely.</p>
<p>So, I want to ask you about more Frederick things, and to see you and get a word of benediction before I go&#8212;and assure you of my true duty, and that I&#8217;m</p>

<salute>Dearest Papa,</salute></opener>
<p>I would write to you often, &#8212; and thankfully, if I had pleasant things to tell you, but every time I come abroad, I have a deeper sense of the advancing ruin of every country except your Germany,&#8212;nor do I believe that it will escape unpunished for its cruelty.</p>
<p>I have felt that more than ever, in passing through France this last time. Had Germany in her great strength, held herself on the defensive patiently, contented with crushing back every Frenchman who crossed Rhine, the humiliation to France would have been greater; but the shame would have been wholesome.&#8212;Now, blind with rage and pain like a dog beaten till it is mad, she will find her time.</p>
<p>Italy is in rapidly advancing decay;&#8212;this place was bad enough 30 years ago; but now!&#8212;what little animal beauty the people had left is in the upper classes, exchanged for a sodden pallor of malignant vice; and in the lower,&#8212;darkened with gradual loss of all that they once believed or delighted in. English companies, over-buying each other ten times succeed as proprietors of the share, and all along the bay is one wilderness of beaten down houses and dustheaps to be sold in lots. Everything is dearer by the double at least, for strangers,&#8212;and the taxes are heavier&#8212;(I hear) under the new government for the peasantry. The fault of <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, to my thinking, is with England. Ever since I was able to understand or see,&#8212;this Naples has been the theme of all artistic, romantic, or pleasure loving creatures;&#8212;how many millions of English people of the upper classes have past winter upon winter here,&#8212;and yet, they have been absolutely without influence on the country, except to encourage manufactures of the foolishest rubbish&#8212;and any kind of amusing beggary.</p>
<p>I leave this afternoon at six, for Palermo; and hope to arrive there tomorrow morning.&#8212;I can only afford a week for Sicily, for I must be back and at my work in Rome this day fortnight. If Mary can send me a little line, to tell me anything you would like to hear of, Hotel de Russie, Rome, is, and will remain for some time, a safe address.</p>
<p>I am going to do what will be ill-thought of by many of my friends; but I do it after a fortnights very careful thought,&#8212;to refuse the gold medal of the Architects&#8217; institute, saying that in the present state of Architecture I cannot think it a time either for bestowing or receiving honours.</p>
<p>&#8212;I shall explain in a private letter to the Secretary, that it is simply impossible for me at present to say anything in public that would be thought due to such a Society on such an occasion. Which is the fact.&#8212;I cannot accept medals from people who let themselves out to build Gothic Advertisements for Railroads&#8212;Greek Advertisements for firms in the city&#8212;and&#8212;whatever Lord Palmerston for Mr. Gladstone chose to order opposite Whitehall&#8212;while they allow every beautiful building in France and Italy to be destroyed, for the &#8220;job&#8221; of its restoration.</p>
<p>I hope I may have some better subject for a letter from Palermo,&#8212;this is merely to tell you I am ever and ever your affectionate</p>

<p>I had yesterday your most kind and loving letter, for a treat, on returning from a vexed expedition to Assisi where I could do nothing for the cold. Please, you must translate that song of Goethe&#8217;s for me, and you must not get old this long while yet.</p>
<p>I have not been so much pleased by anything this many a day as by what you tell me of the Thames embankment,&#8212;for&#8212;steady grumbler as I am, there is really nothing that gives me so much comfort as hearing of anything well done. And also I was afraid that change at Chelsea was all for the worse for you.</p>
<p>I am going to write for a little while to you, as I used to my own father,&#8212;who had his letter every day, whether there was anything in it or not,&#8212;So, sometimes, I may tell you of things which I do not remember when I sit down for a regular letter, (and alas&#8212;too often&#8212;the proposed &#8220;regularity&#8221; becomes&#8212;emptiness, at last)&#8212;</p>
<p>I am almost paralyzed in my own work, now, by horror and pity at the state of all things here. Chiefly, the aspect taken by religion,&#8212;staggering me in what I most want to be strong in faith of, and giving me endless problems and difficulty. If only I could enter into the hearts of one or two of these friars!</p>

<p>This is merely to be a Papa&#8217;s scrap of a letter, for I&#8217;ve had to draw up my formal letter to the Architects&#8217; Institute,&#8212;and must get to my work by the morning light,&#8212;little enough of that I&#8217;ve had lately, but here is some.</p>
<p>I chanced this morning, upon Hosea&#8212;no, Amos, VIII, 4 and 9:&#8212;I am thinking of drawing up some meteorological views founded on those two verses.&#8212;I&#8217;ve got so much in my head if I had only time to take it out!&#8212;time and strength,&#8212;the latter I believe much diminished by overeating myself. I&#8217;m drawing in the Sistine chapel, <hi rend="italic">before</hi> Michael Angelo&#8217;s Last Judgement which disgusts me more and more every day (as I turn casually to it from my own work on Sandro Botticelli&#8217;s maid&#8212;Zipporah)&#8212;and I think continually how strange it is that none of the great old and true painters really worked out that subject in any detail. Fancy the look of a person with some good in him, convinced of all he had lost in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> life&#8212;certainly, in the next, if any probably, merely for the sake of green pease and raspberry [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] tarts.</p>
<p>&#8212;More tomorrow Papa, if you don&#8217;t mind scraps.</p>

<p>I am greatly exercised in mind about the monks here. One sees more of them than in other towns; and last night, close by the temple of Vesta, in a little eleventh century church (Sta M. in Cosmedin), a priest was preaching energetically standing on a raised platform only,&#8212;no desk or anything before him, but as an actor from a small stage&#8212;Energetically&#8212;vociferously&#8212;it seemed in sincerity. But if one could only be in their hearts for one moment. What puzzles me is that the rougher monks certainly live entirely wretched lives. What do they gain by hypocrisy? My life is one of swollen luxury and selfishness compared with theirs; and yet it seems to me that I see what is right and <hi rend="italic">they</hi> don&#8217;t. How is it&#8212;how <hi rend="italic">can</hi> it be?</p>
<p>Anything so dismal as the state of transitional and galvanized Rome I never saw. Two kinds of digging go on side by side&#8212;antiquarian excavations&#8212;and foundations of factories and lodging-houses. The ground, torn newly up in every direction, yawns dusty and raw round the feet of the ruins of Imperial&#8212;that is to say, of clumsy, monstrous, and even then dying Rome.&#8212;New chimneys and the white front of the Pope&#8217;s new Tobacco manufactory, tower up and glare beside the arches of the Palatine&#8212;the lower Roman mob distributing its ordure indiscriminately about&#8212;and the priests&#8212;singing and moaning all day long in any shady church not yet turned into barracks&#8212;</p>
<p>What <hi rend="italic">will</hi> it come to?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve just been correcting the introduction and bit of first chapter of my Botany book, Proserpina&#8212;that I&#8217;ve been underground with so long; and I hope it will be a little refreshing to you after the sulky Fors. I shall order the printer to send you the clear revise.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a little comfort to day in seeing the peasants come driving in to their festa in festa dress. Not much of the common pictorial costume, but the dresses strong and fresh and clean; firmly and decently put on, and always flowers in the hair, not for vanity, but in honour to the day, and with true enjoyment in the look of <hi rend="italic">each other</hi>: and therefore, a really wilful use of the decoration they had, setting themselves off to real, natural, and wise advantage. The men, with a feather or two and flower in their hats looked like gentlemen, and not the least like our &#8220;foresters&#8221; or the like.</p>
<p>I never was glad to see flies before&#8212;two or three are plaguing me to day, to my great contentment.&#8212;it is the first <hi rend="italic">not cold</hi> day I have had here. But I think it will be long before I shall have had enough of the sun.</p>
<p>I have good news too of my Oxford roadmakers. I believe my class in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> art will be the good one, and go on with me to all others.</p>

<p>On Whitsunday, and last night I was at a church-service entirely beautiful and satisfactory to me, as far as anything human ought to be&#8212;that of the nuns of the Trinita di Monte, (of the Sacred Heart). It is an educational Convent, and for all the years I can remember&#8212;(now thirty five) has been notable for its beautifully sung service, organ and women&#8217;s voices only, but very highly trained, yet remaining entirely modest and quiet, strong in effortless execution and perfectly right doing of the duty of sweet voices what charm may justly belong to the externals of such things&#8212;what allowable picturesqueness and romance of association, in the true remnant of a piece of old religion, really serviceable is all here added to the pleasant sense that all is for the patient and secluded preparation for active life; and not merely the refusal, or the weary close of it.</p>
<p>The perfect order, reverence and loveliness of the thing throughout, were a great comfort to me, the rest of my day being necessarily spent either with the sad wrecks of a good past, or under the intrusion of frightful and unseemly modern life.</p>
<p>I am sorely puzzled what element of this kind to try for, in the education which I ought very soon now to be more specially describing in Fors. But I can&#8217;t think it out, yet, and am resting with my botany a little.</p>

<salute>Dear Papa,</salute></opener>
<p>I haven&#8217;t written for a day or two because I had nothing to tell you&#8212;but yesterday I saw what may interest you&#8212;a buried&#8212;or (properly), <hi rend="italic">dug</hi> church of the 2nd or 3rd century. Most of the <hi rend="italic">show</hi> churches here have been altered by half a dozen popes, and finally gone all over with new paint and putty by a modern upholsterer&#8212;But this little church has just been dug down into, in a hill of the Campagna. I suppose it <hi rend="italic">fell</hi> in first, and so showed where it was, or rather, the roof having fallen and brought down the aisle pillars, ages ago, there remained a depression in the soil which attracted the excavators.</p>
<p>There, however, one stood among the fallen pillars and broken tombs, not one touched&#8212;nor one added&#8212;since the last tomb was closed&#8212;and one saw exactly how far the first thoughts of Christianity changed the temper and work of the Roman. One sculpture of &#8220;the good shepherd&#8221; in the midst of a group of sheep and cattle&#8212;the same that were grazing in the Campagna at the moment&#8212;overhead&#8212;with the same long horns, and great effort on the part of the rude sculptor to show the projecting balls of the large eyes, would have been impressive to me, if anything could be impressive, now. But all things have become to me so ghastly a confusion, and grotesque mistake and misery, that I <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> nothing,&#8212;(except that the man with the grinding organ outside is a nuisance at seven in the morning and not in the same order of things as my singing nuns at seven in the evening), and enjoy nothing. All dawn light seems to me only on the smoke of Etna.</p>
<p>Etna is in a mess, because I had nearly written, the smoke of <hi rend="italic">dinner</hi>; for I was thinking, in advance, whether my views this morning were not a little more desperate than usual, in consequence of having eaten green pease as well as asparagus, last night.</p>

<salute>My Dearest Papa,</salute></opener>
<p>I am so very glad of your letter and Mary&#8217;s. I did not stop in the daily news because I couldn&#8217;t go on, but because I was afraid you were away from home and would only find an unreadable mass of dead letters when you came back. Now I can go on again nicely. Your pleasure in the embankment is a great joy to me, what else you tell me&#8212;of your too quiet time, may well be sad. But it seems to me there are some subjects of thought, connected with your own past work, which such too sorrowful leisure might nevertheless be grandly spent in. None of your readers, I believe,&#8212;none even of the most careful&#8212;know precisely, in anything <hi rend="italic">like</hi> practical approximation&#8212;what sympathy you have with the faith of Abbot Samson, or St Adalbert&#8212;I don&#8217;t know myself; to me, the question of their faith is a fearful mystery, but one which I am sure is to be solved;&#8212;I mean that we shall either live up to Christianity, or refuse it. But I don&#8217;t know what your own inner thoughts are of the faith&#8212;such as you told me of your mother&#8212;and such as so many noble souls have had in Scotland.</p>
<p>What final sayings you would leave to men on this, now quite near and dreadful arbitration which England has to make&#8212;&#38; which you have left her as yet but with dim assertion upon; Truely, this might well occupy many an otherwise valuless [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] hour?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t write of myself today&#8212;being tired&#8212;I am so glad of all you give me of encouragement and sympathy. The Oxford movement was, of course, long since planned by me; but I did not intend to begin it till the close of my drawing work: (the wholly ineffectual trouble of which prevented all other energy). But one or two of the men themselves asked me to begin now&#8212;so I let them.&#8212;And truly, I think it will grow.&#8212;Next October, I go out myself with them, and hope to get other tutors to join. Gradually, I mean to develop a plan for the draining of the Oxford fields, which are under water at present all winter; and&#8212;Well, enough for today.&#8212;Ever your loving</p>

<salute>My dearest Papa,</salute></opener>
<p>I come down here to write, every morning now. The Sacristan makes me a cup of coffee, and then leaves me quiet for three hours, from 7 to 10,&#8212;and I get much done. The room is precisely that of a Highland cottage but too windowed,&#8212;whitewashed walls&#8212;the windows in deep recesses, three feet high by two wide, looking out on&#8212;not Scottish, but nevertheless, true Highlands&#8212;a deep valley set with olives, running up into limestone hills covered with pasture and forest, 2 to 3000 feet&#8212;then above,&#8212;rising in rocky and arid slopes of Apennine.</p>
<p>St. Francis lies in his grave about thirty yards from me, across the cloister&#8212;it is (for a marvel,) a sweet summer morning, and the birds sing at the windows&#8212;or at least in the wood underneath them&#8212;for the monastery is built on a slope as steep as that under Stirling castle.</p>
<p>I have just been having a wonderfully interesting piece of passionate legend-telling, from the Sacristan. He couldn&#8217;t find Isaiah the other day and was looking for it hopelessly in the &#8220;index&#8221; to a commented Bible&#8212;but, set him off on the story of St. Anthony preaching to the fishes&#8212;on this lake&#8212;and he is delicious. And his heart is in it.&#8212;Also&#8212;he agrees wholly with Papa and me, that there never was on earth yet such a horrible age as this, for corruption and madness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember,&#8221; he says, &#8220;what Fra Antonio tells you&#8212;I may die or live to see it, but, before this age is over, (questo secolo) [&#8220;this century or age&#8221;] there will be such a plague, or war as has not been yet in the world,&#8212;and few men left, from the chastisement of God.&#8221;&#8212;And truly&#8212;things are too horrible to last long now. I am tired with many thoughts about what I have to do, and my own feebleness or worthlessness.</p>
<p>&#8212;Can&#8217;t write more this morning.</p>

<p>There is the prettiest portrait of you here close by me, in the lower church, as the leading Wise King, kissing the feet of Christ. It is by Taddeo Gaddi, not Giotto&#8212;Terribly high up&#8212;I only can see it through my glass,&#8212;nobody in general sees anything here&#8212;or knows even what they come to see, for the monks added chapels all round, and put in dark painted glass, in the 15th century, and the frescoes, ever since, have been absolutely invisible except on perfectly fine afternoons in June and July. What I wanted to say yesterday was, more distinctly this&#8212;</p>
<p>You have perfectly shown the value of sincerity in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> faith moderately concurrent with the laws of nature and humanity. Faith in Allah&#8212;or Jupiter&#8212;or Christ.&#8212;</p>
<p>You have shown the power of living without any faith&#8212;in charity and utility&#8212;as Frederick.</p>
<p>And what you say of Friederick&#8217;s [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] sorrowful surroundings and impossibilities of believing anything is to me the most precious passage of the whole book, &#8212;many though there be&#8212;priceless.</p>
<p>But you don&#8217;t say what you would have Frederick <hi rend="italic">be</hi>? You don&#8217;t say what a Master ought now to teach his pupils to believe, or at least, wish them to believe.</p>
<p>And this, remember is now a quite vital and practical question for me at Oxford.&#8212;</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t easily answer your question, what I am doing;&#8212;it is so mixed; but, mainly writing a patient and true account of this place, the source of so much religious passion throughout Europe, and drawing bits that I think nobody but I can draw affectionately enough. I have been at work today on Love, Death, and the Devil. The latter is the perfect likeness of an average &#8220;practical&#8221; Englishman. Giotto has the most intense hatred of that sort of person.</p>
<p>Love is blind with a string of hearts round his neck, and lovely rose and violet wings&#8212; &#8220;Penitence&#8221; is flogging him and Death out of the way. I hope to let you see something, very like it, for my drawing is coming well.</p>

<salute>Dearest Papa,</salute></opener>
<p>It is the first pure day of summer here. There is no cloud, and no poison wind. I think you will like to know the view out my little windows.</p>
<p>As I sit&#8212;the cloudless sky and green-and-gold Apennine;&#8212;cornfield with grass&#8212;clumps of olive, grey, and dark spots of ilex. If I rise, under the window the hill falls steeply about 500 feet, clothed with broken wood&#8212;near the window, fig and Spanish chestnut, below&#8212;ilex, down to the stream bed&#8212;the Tescio [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]; (see Dante&#8217;s account of St. Francis in the Paradiso. No, I&#8217;ve got confused, I see Dante doesn&#8217;t name it. L&#8217;<hi rend="italic">acqua</hi>, etc., in Canto xi. is it, I believe, but I don&#8217;t know Tupino) which is all but dry; it runs beneath, <hi rend="italic">across</hi> the window, but fronting me, comes down to it, winding for a couple of miles, a pretty tributary brook between low thickets, with rich cornfields on each side of it, and, in the whole visible space of country up to the hills, there are countable eleven rough farmstead or cottages and roofs of them&#8212;(too broken&#8212;for the good of the owners &#8212;or virtue).</p>
<p>Beside the brook, five reapers have begun their work in a golden field&#8212;the white specks of them gleam changefully in the sunshine.&#8212;A bird of two is singing a little. &#42;</p>
<p>The room has a summer murmur of flies in it&#8212;(just a fly or two too many&#8212;brother Anthony, the Sacristan not being careful about washing up) and I&#8217;m writing down the measure of this upper church&#8212;very difficult to get accurately.&#8212;I&#8217;ve been reading Lamentations IV. and thinking that I&#8217;m precious son of Zion comparable to fine gold, but I can&#8217;t make out who &#8220;they&#8221; is, and who &#8220;them&#8221; is in the 15th and 16th verses.</p>

<salute>My dearest Papa,</salute></opener>
<p>I&#8217;m not so comfortable in my cell, this morning, for it being quite cloudless, and very hot, the cicadas are delighted, and the consequence is that the Spanish chestnut under the window is filled with a quantity of small watchman&#8217;s rattles, which never stop going for an instant. Also I&#8217;m a little out of temper, &#8212;for all the beggars in Assisi, that&#8217;s five sixths of its population, know me, now; and the stupid and vile ones come at me like wasps at a rotten nectarine&#8212;wherever I move. Their unfathomable stupidity is the thing that torments me most, thinking to get money by importunity at every corner, bearing up against being sent to the Devil&#8212;with exactly the sort of obstinacy [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] that flies have&#8212;or goats&#8212;</p>
<p>In other respects, my presence here is on the whole, healthy for the place. I made them wash down their cloister thoroughly the other day,&#8212;and got the sacristan to stop the blackguard boys of the town from playing bowls at the church door. The boys returning again and again, when he was out of the way, he took courage, under my adjuration, to confiscate three of the bowls. This ended the business satisfactorily. Two of the boys laid wait afterwards to throw stones at me, in my morning walk.&#8212;I didn&#8217;t see them&#8212;but as Fors would have it, the Syndic&#8212;looking early out of his window&#8212;did; and put them both in prison. The church porch is now left in peace, and the respectable people touch their hats to me&#8212;So much for Liberty and Equality.</p>
<p>I wonder what you&#8217;ll say to the July Fors! and the French and German bits!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so ashamed of having written so ill, but am tired this morning.</p>

<p>It is getting very hot here, and if I had not a cave to work in, I should have come away. But the lower church is always cool. You can imagine it easily as two large chimney pots cut in half and dovetailed so forming nave and transepts only instead of crossing simply at the same height&#8212;like that, where they cross, the <hi rend="italic">diagonal</hi> arches are semi-circular also, which gives a vault like that lifted in the middle&#8212;on the four compartments of this vault, as at thus, the pictures which I&#8217;ve mainly got to work on are painted, the figures all sloping together to the points of them.</p>
<p>Then the upper church is built over this lower railway tunnel one like that and finally the tunnel mouths are stopped up and the cloister and convent added and there you are on the top of the hill, like Stirling Castle.&#8212;I&#8217;m writing to day in the convent lumber room, the coolest place I can find.&#8212;Here&#8217;s my table and chair, look, on enclosed leaf, and all my books before me. I&#8217;m sadly ashamed of writing this so badly, but somehow when I&#8217;m thinking I can&#8217;t shape the letters.</p>

<salute>Dearest Papa,</salute></opener>
<p>If you have any word to me, now, direct to Perugia, for I am driven away from here by the noise at night, and beggars in the day. I have done two pieces of kindness, which have buzzed all over the town and produced the impression of my being either a fool, or an angel with unlimited command of money, in either case to be made the most of. And the thirsty, lazy, hungry, miserable and totally uncared for population is coming upon me like a swarm of rats.</p>
<p>The proper practical English conclusion upon this would be,&#8212;&#8220;there, you see what it is to give money. Never give anybody anything,&#8221; &#8212;&#38;c. Whereas my own feeling&#8212;or better than feeling&#8212;knowledge, is exactly that of a man on a raft in the midst of a wreck, who has rescued two wretches and sees all the sea full of hands held up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kick them away,&#8221; says the practical Englishman&#8212; &#8220;Haven&#8217;t they wrecked themselves&#8221;? &#8220;Yes, of course they have. They had no pilot&#8212;no captain&#8212;no compass&#8212;and no port. They drifted here&#8212;and drank all the rum in the hold before they came ashore&#8212;You wiseacre&#8212;don&#8217;t I know all that as wells as you&#8212;but what&#8217;s to be done now&#8221;?</p>
<p>Meantime, the sense of the extreme and utterly hopeless misery of the country almost unfits me for doing any work in it at all. While the cheerful English tourist goes dancing and coquetting about&#8212;and has been fifty years finding his pleasure and education in Italy&#8212;and never done it one pennyworth of good&#8212;How much <hi rend="italic">harm</hi>, the devil only knows.</p>

<salute>My dearest Papa,</salute></opener>
<p>You have never sent me that translation from Goethe yet, and I am very faithfully and deeply desirous of it. I tremble for what you will say about the German bits in July Fors.</p>
<p>I am worried here as Fors will have it, by an inflexible German artist to whom I can teach nothing,&#8212;and who contrasts unfavourably with a flexible young Italian, who expects me to teach him everything. Seriously, a receptive, docile, eager youth, very thankful to be shown a thing or two. The German is only anxious to prove that what he does is the best that can be done,&#8212;and it is very poor, and very narrow.</p>
<p>The heat has come heavy at last and I begin to think of home. I want to see the &#8220;Mont&#8221; of Simon of Montfort, by Seine side, as I come back, and if France is pleasant may linger there&#8212;but this is only a scratch today because I was getting out of my morning habit of writing, and was thinking of that translation.</p>

<salute>My dearest Papa,</salute></opener>
<p>I&#8217;ve been in a somewhat wo[e]ful state, for this week past, The Root of bitterness is falling in my drawings of not being able to finish them,&#8212;the sense of&#8212;that German word you quote from Goethe, meaning weakness in one&#8217;s craft,&#8212;being indeed worst of all to bear. But on this root, the sense of the vileness of the whole population about me,&#8212;and not less of my own, according to my better opportunities I want to lead strongly now, in this Fors movement, for I see it must be done, not said, and I am so luxurious and dependent on all that I say people should be independent of.&#8212;However, I don&#8217;t doubt but that things will clear themselves to me as I get nearer them. It seems to me the first thing I have to do, next term at Oxford, is simply to make a present of my fine rooms, with their Titian, Turners, and Gothic MSS, value&#8212;at most temperately calculated market price, thirty thousand pounds within the oak door&#8212;to Corpus Christi College itself as a part of their library, and myself to take up a proper student&#8217;s establishment, on the scale of a great Earl of Essex, (Froude Short studies, last series, p.330) but I don&#8217;t feel much inclined to do this, yet awhile&#8212;and at all events, will come and have a chat over with Papa first.&#8212;You need not be frightened and think I&#8217;m getting excited and wrong headed. I never was more lazy or less enthusiastic&#8212;but one can&#8217;t preach simplicity of life with one&#8217;s room-furniture worth 30,000; and I&#8217;ve got to preach simplicity of life, if <hi rend="italic">any</hi>thing.</p>

<salute>My Dearest Papa,</salute></opener> 
<p>I have your lovely letter, so full of pleasantness for me; chiefly in telling that I give you pleasure by putting you in the place of the poor Father, who used to be <hi rend="italic">so</hi> thankful for his letter, and content with so little. &#8220;If only I would date accurately,&#8221; said he: (and never got me to do it!).</p>
<p>What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the use of that terrible law of Nature that one knows all that is best to know, too late. But it is a great comfort to me to think that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> also will be glad to see the postman stop sometimes. Your reading all those pieces that my mother chose is very wonderful and helpful to me. To think she should be able to give some new thoughts even to you!</p>
<p>I will note with extreme fidelity and care all you tell me of Germany and France.</p>
<p>I want mainly to ask you to give my love to Froude when you next see him. I will write some morning letter to him also, now&#8212;for the little while before he leaves. I am glad he is going on any mission in which he is interested, and thankful that his words are of weight with government in any matter. But what Colonial problem can there be, soluble by any formula, until the Home problem has become&#8212;I do not say soluble&#8212;but even intelligible? When your emigration is nothing but the over-boiling of a neglected pot&#8212;what sort of problems can one have out of the fat in the fire? Our modes of dealing with the Aborigines [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] may indeed be looked into with advantage. I heard, and have no doubt of the truth of the hearing, from the daughter of the Bp. of Natal, that our treatment of the Caffres had been as cruel as dishonourable, and that the effect of it was now remediless.</p>
<p>I am drawing angels carrying buckets of roses here&#8212;with peacocks eyes in their wings. Absolutely alone with them in the gallery today; till they seemed real. But to think that only one monk, out of the hosts, should have been able to draw such! and now that they&#8217;re drawn &#8212;I don&#8217;t know anybody who really cares for them, but myself.</p>

<p>This is only to say where I am,&#8212;or where the shell of me is&#8212;for the kernel is nowhere&#8212;got all black &#38; damp like a bad walnut with biliousness and sulkiness, the two reacting on each other wonderfully when I find 12th century churches being knocked down to build barracks, and billiard-rooms, which is the course of improvement here and elsewhere.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nobody in Florence and only one room in the inn, not under &#8220;restoration.&#8221; That room is twelve of my paces by thirteen and a half, my pace being about a yard, it has three tall windows, and six tall doors&#8212;Over every door is a chandelier with five candles in it, and in the middle of the ceiling a chandelier with 62 candles in it&#8212;at least I count thirty-one on this side as I sit, the furniture is scarlet &#38; gold, the paper green and gold, the doors, all double-folding, hidden by crimson curtains&#8212;a landscape good enough to sell to an American for a Salvator,hangs opposite the windows, &#38; the marble chimney piece is finely sculptured with vine leaves and a nymph going to sacrifice a goat.</p>
<p>The general sense of being in one of the deepest holes of Dante&#8217;s inferno which this room produces on me, after my cell at Assisi, is very unpleasant, this Sunday morning. And so that&#8217;s where I am&#8212;and what I am; and now I must stop, for I&#8217;m behindhand with my letter to the landlords, and its about the right room to get on with it in.</p>

<p>I have been forces to get to my Squireen Fors, in before breakfast times, this week past, and have had no sense to write during the day, under curious vexations&#8212;which best against its modern ways. The good of which plan is, (first, at least) that my letters can be secure, and that if you or Froude have any word to say to me, if addressed Hotel d&#8217;Arno, Florence, it will come safe &#38; quickly.</p>
<p>Any scattered grain you may either, have sent me, to former addresses, I shall gradually gather.&#8212;Having only today finally resolved on this, I send you first word of it. I shall get the Squireen Fors sent off to printers tomorrow with orders to send Froude a proof. I want him to see that one can get into hot water out of Africa, if one chooses.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to speak of <hi rend="italic">colonies</hi> in Fors at all.&#8212; I do hope that Froude will take up the subject on his own and gradually concentrate his influence on some practical matter which will lead on to the truth. In haste today. Ever your and his affectionate.</p>

<p>I was out among the vines and maize last night, across the Serchio&#8212;now only a mountain stream, running among long banks of shingle, and <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> clear;&#8212;but with no voice, like Tweed or Liddel. I shut my eyes and listened, to find if by any imagination&#8212;or honest defiance of imagination&#8212;I could fancy myself listening to Tweed at Melrose. But no&#8212;utterly shallow and empty&#8212;the Italian stream in voice, as an Italian opera song to the fullest of Burns, in thought. The reasons were clear enough, on looking. The shingle was as wide as Tweed&#8217;s, but was of dull limestone instead of ringing quartz&#8212;and for twenty <hi rend="italic">round</hi> pebbles, lay one square stone. The water flowed past, silently instead of tinkling <hi rend="italic">through</hi>.&#8212;In the second place,&#8212;there were no deepcut channels through enduring rock, to give gush, and hollow tone&#8212;the bass to the pebble-trebble. Nothing but waste of stones and sand&#8212;the signs of the folly and misery which left the river to overflow the plain in winter.</p>
<p>I went on, through winding lanes between maize and vine&#8212;sunset turning into little nimbuses the bunches of white filaments at the ends of the ears of maize&#8212;the peasants at work, of old Etruscan feature, bidding me good evening rightly and quietly. At last at the turn of a path, I met a pretty dark-edged boy of eleven or twelve years old. He knelt down in front of me quickly, silently, like a dog ordered to do so, on both knees&#8212;holding out his cap. There was no servility in the action anymore than would be in the dog&#8217;s&#8212;great beauty in it&#8212;and in the entirely quiet face, not beseeching, but submitting its cause to you. I never saw such a thing before. The real root of it is in Etruscan religion, and the Ghibelline training of the old town, in Castruccio&#8217;s time, &#38; before. But, if Castruccio had forseen it!&#8212;in fields of his own Lucca&#8212;as he went out on his triumphal march at Rome!</p>

<salute>My Dearest Papa,</salute></opener>
<p>I only got your lovely letter of 30th July this moment at breakfast, having been kept here by unlooked-for difficulties in work, and <hi rend="italic">delights</hi> in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>I underline that word, because I want you to be assure I don&#8217;t write to you in mere <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi> misery. I&#8217;ve plenty of that, and know it well. But I never allow it to alter my thoughts of things. I was wretched in the Florence room, because I knew it to be English Nidification in Florence, and the Sum of English Influence there. And that it was pure Hell fire&#8212;in the midst of what I have here, every evening;&#8212;a country of Marble rocks&#8212;of purple hills, and skies of softest light&#8212;under which <hi rend="italic">still</hi> dwell a people who labour, &#38; pray. You like the &#8220;David&#8221; because&#8212;it is the only piece of true Tuscan sculpture you have been able to <hi rend="italic">see</hi>. Its colossal size recues it from the Kensington lumber&#8212;you cannot see any <hi rend="italic">other</hi> piece of Florence work but in its place.&#8212;I am at work here on the statue carved in the olden time, &#8220;Lady Gladness&#8221; (Ilaria) of Caretto&#8212;it lies on her tomb quite open&#8212;at the cathedral wall, as if she had been in, and laid there while they sang the burial service. Thirty years ago, a modern radical&#8212;one of the school of that Florence drawing room&#8212;put his hat on the face of it as he was talking to me, thinking it would answer handily to keep said hat from the dust.</p>
<p>As I was working there, last week, two of the Lucca countrywomen came in, and stopped at it suddenly,&#8212;then knelt down&#8212;and kissed the hem of its robe. &#8220;Yes, she deserves your kiss,&#8221; I said. They opened their great black eyes wide, half-frightened, like pretty wild animals. &#8220;Che santo &#233;?&#8221; [&#8220;what saint is it?&#8221;] said bravest of them, at last.</p>
<p>These are the people whom Froude is leaving to be crushed to death&#8212;to breed Englishmen on black pepper. (He had better give them gunpowder at once&#8212;for permanent diet&#8212;and then set them to, &#8212;fire-eating.) And you, Papa, preaching <hi rend="italic">patience</hi> to me!</p>
<p>I happen, by Fors care, to have under my hand two leaves of an old lecture, cancelled and kept to be worked up farther&#8212;perhaps Mary won&#8217;t mind looking over the second before reading it to you. I don&#8217;t, so she must.&#8212;Mind it is <hi rend="italic">s</hi>ighting not <hi rend="italic">f</hi>ighting.</p>
<p>Ever your loving filius.&#8212;more tomorrow about Montfort, see 4th page. Love to Mary&#8212;I couldn&#8217;t answer a difficult bit in her letter, tell her, about the Bible but I&#8217;ll try to do so.</p>
<p>I must have made a mistake, I <hi rend="italic">meant tomb</hi> of Coeur de Lion&#8212;<hi rend="italic">Forts</hi> of Mont<hi rend="italic">fort</hi>. I believe Evesham to have been the fatallest battle ever fought in Europe&#8212;But can&#8217;t say why today.</p>

<salute>My Dearest Papa,</salute></opener>
<p>I&#8217;ve just been reading the prayer of Judith&#8212;(Judith IX). (If Froude is with you still, tell him I do so wish he&#8217;d stop from his Missionary business, and write a <hi rend="italic">Philistine&#8217;s</hi> history of Delilah.)&#8212;But how glorious those 8th and IXth chapters are.</p>
<p>It is no wonder you disbelieve in Art, papa. Of the history of John the Baptist, and of Judith, the practical Sum and substance, to the British and other public, is two pretty girls carrying two bloody heads,&#8212;which is what the Painters &#38; Sculptors as a Body have seen, in these matters, with the utmost of eyes they had&#8212;the Italo-French schools giving further flavour to the apocryphal story by scornfully sniffing at Judith&#8217;s report of the way she passed the night.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the loveliest day I have seen in Italy this year.&#8212;I was up after dinner 1500 feet on the hills to the south, in a little stubble field, hedged with chestnut and wild bay; the field itself terraced out of the steep hillside in banks about four feet high&#8212;which lay, like a line of steep bastions&#8212;green&#8212;successive&#8212;fragrant, with all manner of herbs&#8212;relieved against the blue mountains of Carrara, twenty miles away.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed how steady I am to my purpose of terracing the Apennines like this&#8212;everywhere on their soft ground, and catching all the rain. The spear into the sickle&#8212;the Bastion, into banks like this. But I scarcely hope to see it with my own eyes.</p>
<p>I must get to my work. Ever your loving Filius.</p><closer></closer>

<salute>My dear Mary,</salute></opener>
<p>I&#8217;m greatly pleased with your pretty note, and account of your uncle, and of the Thames&#8217; future prospects, and of Mr. Elwin&#8217;s house,&#8212;the last, to me, most interesting, but in a way you won&#8217;t guess, though you may find out by chance some day, but I won&#8217;t tell you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking so often of your last letter, and the difference between the education of thoughtful young persons, fifty years ago, and now. What puzzles me, is how you all take things so quietly&#8212;and rest content in doubt, and perpetual questioning&#8212;with no answer. &#8220;He said he would come back again and tell us all about it, and we waited, and waited, but never came, &#8220;said my old German courier to me, tonight, (as he carried my hammer for me up a glen in the intensely hard Etruscan marble which needs a doubly heavier one than any rock I know)&#8212;of himself and his seven brothers and sisters after their father&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>It is mainly my sense of this calamitous mystery&#8212;less and less thought of <hi rend="italic">as</hi> a calamity&#8212;which keeps me from putting Fors into more practical form. I can&#8217;t get my foundation on <hi rend="italic">any</hi> faith.</p>
<p>I am tired tonight and intensely stupid&#8212;but would not sleep before acknowledging your second letter, and am ever</p>

<salute>My Dearest Papa,</salute></opener>
<p>Yesterday evening I was climbing among the ravines of marble to the south; and came on a cottage like a Highland one&#8212;for roughness of look&#8212;only the mountain path winding round beneath it, went under a roof of vines trellised from its eaves, and opened before it entered the darkness of green leaves, into a golden threshing floor&#8212;the real &#8220;area&#8221; of the Latins. That so few people past [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] that the people could make their threshing floor of the path, was the first deep prettiness of it. Then, they <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been threshing and winnowing&#8212;the little level field was soft with chaff. The marble rocks&#8212;bright gray&#8212;came down steep into it, as at Loch Katrine the rocks into the water below, on the other side, the hill went down steep to the blue plain of Lucca&#8212;itself (the hillside) one grove of olive&#8212;but&#8212;as I saw&#8212;without fruit&#8212;or nearly so.</p>
<p>I crossed the threshing floor, and met the peasant under his vines, looking pale and worn&#8212;the Lucchese &#8220;Good even Signoria, [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]&#8221; given with more than usual gentleness. I said to him what I thought of his happy place,&#8212;as well as I could. Yes, he said, but it was a &#8220;very dry&#8221; country. &#8220;The olives had no fruit this year&#8212;see&#8212;the berries had all fallen, withered for want of rain. For want of <hi rend="italic">water</hi>, yes, I said&#8212;why don&#8217;t you catch it on the hillside, before it runs to the Serchio and the sea? In short, I found him able to hear, and think&#8212;He was actually building a cistern behind his house to catch the rain. &#8220;From the <hi rend="italic">roof</hi>&#8221;! (And the Roof from which he ought to receive it rose above him&#8212;1500 feet of pure marble!)&#8212;I had a long talk&#8212;I examined the place; and though I&#8217;ve got to go to Florence today to hunt down St. Dominic, if I don&#8217;t come back to do a little bit of engineering beside that man&#8217;s threshing floor&#8212;it will be, not my fault, God willing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written a shabby little letter to Mary,&#8212;but couldn&#8217;t help it.</p>

<salute>My dear Mary,</salute></opener>
<p>In looking over your letter again yesterday, I found a little note of admiration which I had not observed before, after Mr. Elwin&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>I do believe, under that grave little face of yours, there lies hidden as hearty a love of mischief as ever any young lady or kitten, or other charming juvenile animal was blessed with&#8212;and that you knew very well what you were about.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;ll forgive your mischievousness, in thanks for your having read Fors&#8212;even to the notes.&#8212;And now, seriously, remember that a life may be entirely <hi rend="italic">exemplary</hi>; yet entirely selfish.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that Mr. Elwin <hi rend="italic">enjoys himself</hi> moral, with his charming and well brought up family, his swallows in church, his&#8212;no doubt excellent&#8212;sermons, and his very learned and accurate biography of Pope, than he could in any other life.</p>
<p>Meantime, while he is proving that the most intelligibly more poet of England lied about his letters, Mr Elwin goes up into his pulpit every 7th day, to tell his congregation that such and such things are so, concerning God and his ways.</p>
<p>Now, if he tells them one word more, positively, than Pope has written in his universal prayer&#8212;He tells them&#8212;what is in all probability a lie&#8212;at least what no man living can prove to be true&#8212;and he tells them this, assuming to be a messenger from God. Which, think you, is the worst Liar&#8212;Pope&#8212;or the self-styled God&#8217;s messanger with no credentials?</p>
<p>But that is not all.</p>
<p>He is perfectly happy with his children and his swallows. So could I be, with my pictures and nightengales [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]&#8212;if I liked&#8212;and perhaps something else than a nightengale, in a cage.&#8212;Well, I could perhaps even get <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, if I looked for it;&#8212;But, I choose to consider whether other people are happy&#8212;Bill Sykes and Nancy&#8212;shall we say?</p>
<p>And I enquire, why Bill Sykes and Nancy are not happy.</p>
<p>And I find&#8212;briefly&#8212;that it is because people listen to Mr. Elwin, instead of to Pope, whose one couplet</p>
<lg><l>&#8220;Never elated,&#8212;while one man&#8217;s opprest,</l>
<l>Never dejected, while another&#8217;s blest&#8221;</l></lg>
<p>&#8212;is worth all the Sermons, taking the best of them, and leaving out the lies, that I&#8217;ve heard since I was born&#8212;And I&#8217;ve heard better than Mr. Elwin&#8217;s, I can tell you.</p>

<p>&#8230;your little account of Michael Angelo&#8217;s David. I don&#8217;t know if it is to be returned but in any case it is quite safe.</p>

<p>I have not been writing lately, a great overpress of new discovery having kept me at work, even at night, vainly trying to set the things down. They show themselves to me and then vanish, and I can&#8217;t keep up with the story of the magic lantern.</p>

<salute>My dearest Papa,</salute></opener>
<p>I have been hindered from getting up to town this evening; and must dine at Balliol tomorrow, so that I fear the cold double journey in this snowtime, and must resign myself to the loss of my happy hour tomorrow with you; I was going to have brought poor Rosie to see you, but she is too ill to bear coming out just now&#8212; next Saturday, at all events, I shall keep tryste, if I&#8217;m well; my lectures will be over, and I shall be free-hearted.</p>
<p>I expect a report soon from Mr. Merritt on John Knox: but he is displeased with me for not going to see <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, and may be dilatory.</p>
<p>Three of my men have asked leave to come to talk&#8212;or learn&#8212;about St. George&#8217;s Company. I&#8217;ve asked them to breakfast on Monday.</p>

<salute>My dear Mary,</salute></opener>
<p>I send you a &#8220;revise&#8221; of our card&#8212;they stupidly used only one name. If you are pouring thee yourself any day you will find my old servant Lucy very thankful for a little chat, and the chat with her not unpleasant. Dearest love to my papa&#8212;I thought him so sweet and dear and well the other day.</p>

<p>The enclosed opinion from Merritt, though it does not go far, is pleasant, it seems to me, as far as it does go. I do not doubt our being able to get nearer the picture when the Secretary is better.</p>

<salute>My dear Mary,</salute></opener>
<p>It was not your uncle&#8217;s fault. He is never inaccurate. It was entirely mine, I supposing, and not listening, that there was only one place where portraits were shown, and that blunt &#8220;Kensington&#8221; was enough.</p>
<p>I am as much delighted as I ought to be by the interest of the reports by Mr. Merritt on the true picture&#8212;and am still happier to be able to assure you that I never did mention nor could have mentioned the name of Porbus [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]; for&#8212;though I have often in my life heard it&#8212;I never by any chance recollect it&#8212;but confuse it with Phoebus, &#38; thus get rid of the taste of it as soon as I can.</p>
<p>To [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Mr. Merritt&#8217;s testimony is crystal-clear from all prejudice or adulteration.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had ten days of unbroken black fog, and can&#8217;t get up in the morning.</p>
<p>I can always be at my work in winter at seven if&#8212;between seven and eight&#8212;I see the blue of dawn. But to get up at seven when one is to breakfast by full candlelight at nine, beats me.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why papa has had no letters. The little light between nine or ten goes in my day&#8217;s work and leaves me&#8212;to disguised to speak, and ashamed of myself, Coniston, and the Universe&#8212;but ever faithfully and affectionately Papa&#8217;s and yours</p>

<p>The book found me today, more than usually helpless and, earthy. How should it be so, when you say&#8212;what you have said in your gift&#8212;and feel me to be anything to you. And yet day by day, my soul cleaves to the dust&#8212;or&#8212;rather the dust to what soul I had.</p>
<p>&#8212;Absolute illness though not serious, alters my thoughts just now, and I will not grieve you by telling you ow needful your precious words were.</p>
<p>&#8212;I had but begun glancing at the book, deeply thankful for the Northern History in this consummate form.&#8212;I must try to get stronger, that I may not feel too poor to live, in the presence of such creatures.</p>
<p>&#8212;I shall see you again next week, unless it may be, I can&#8217;t shake off the cold without some change of air. But I&#8217;ll write to you&#8212;if I go anywhere it will be to see one of my best pupils at Arundel.</p>

<salute>Dearest Papa,</salute></opener>
<p>I have had so little to say of myself, pleasing to a Papa&#8217;s ear, that I neither wrote nor came when I was last in London&#8212;for the rest, the Academy work involved much weariness. I had just got it done, with other worldliness, and was away into the meadows to see buttercup and clover and bean blossom, when the news came that the little story of my wild Rose was ended, and the hawthorn blossoms, this year&#8212;would fall&#8212;over her. Since which piece of news, I have not had a day but in more or less active business, in which everybody congratulates &#38; felicitates me, and must be met with civil cheerfulness. Among the few rests or goods I get indeed&#8212;the reading of the Knox&#8217;s portraits has been the chief. I never saw a more close, inevitable piece of picture criticism; and the incidental sketches of Wishart and Knox are invaluable.</p>
<p>I am coming to town in a week or ten days now. What possesses Froude to go away again so soon? Love to Mary.&#8212;</p>

<p>I would fain write to you every morning, but am at present so depressed, and so overworked, inevitably by the mere interests and thoughts of the passing spring days, so few of them&#8212;so full of cloud and flower sight or question, now&#8212;as it seems to me&#8212;only to be rightly or at all dealt with by the knowledge and feelings which I have only gained in declining life, and, by warnings too clear, know cannot last but a few years, if that, in available strength&#8212;what obscure stuff I am writing!&#8212;I mean, that every cloud on the hills is a problem to me, every weed on the banks; every sentence I read of old books, has new force to me, and I want to begin work over again, with a boy&#8217;s strength.</p>
<p>I wonder how far you have this same feeling, increased by the sorrowful quiet in which you now stay;&#8212;surely&#8212;age should not, those who have laboured so nobly, be sorrowful; and yet, my own sorrow certainly is rooted in the sense of inability to work for ever.</p>
<p>You see <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can&#8217;t write, neither&#8212;Indeed, I would write beautifully and legibly to you, if I could, but I scrawl so much&#8212;it can&#8217;t be. Mary sent me such a lovely bit of yours about books.&#8212;please thank her for it and for her letter.</p>

<salute>My dear Mary,</salute></opener>
<p>You should before now have received Ulric de Knecht, and I cannot tell you how very happy I am in the thought of your translating it, with occasionally a flash of guidance or sprinkle of salt from you uncle.&#8212;It will give three times the value to the book that it has been so done; and the character of Frenel deserves it, no less than of the housemistress.</p>
<p>I think it would be well to keep the German Knecht in our title, and call it, &#8220;Ulrich the Knecht,&#8221;&#8212;this will serve to lead us to another kind of knighthood.</p>
<p>For, in our company, the title of Servant is to be the highest!&#8212;There are to be three orders of companies;&#8212;namely (lowest) C. Retainers, who though taking the vow, are paid as labourers: clerks, &#38; Companions simple; who are paid nothing, but attend more to their own business than the Company&#8217;s, giving the tenth of their income however, always,&#8212;and Companion-Servants who devote themselves wholly to the Company&#8217;s work. They will write themselves</p>
<p>C.C. of <sup>st</sup>George</p>
<p>C. of <sup>st</sup>George</p>
<p>C.S. of <sup>st</sup>George, which will be equivalent to the Knighthood in other orders. </p>
<p>The book has perhaps been sent to Broadland, by mistake, but will soon come. </p>

<p>Was it a sparrow, or robin, I forget, that you were watching the little eyes and ways and pleasures of, when the sense of its having been a bit of yellow jelly not a year before, and the miracle of it, came on you so? I wish I could recollect what you called the egg aspect of it&#8212;perhaps Mary can? it was infinitely better than any &#8220;bit of yellow jelly&#8221;&#8212;yet I can&#8217;t think.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been looking at Humboldt. I see he &#8220;defines&#8221; the vital force as &#8220;that which prevents the original affinities from acting.&#8221; Not at all which act itself! What a lovely and cheerful view of life! (Mortal and other).

<salute>Dear Mr. Ruskin,</salute></opener>
<p>My Uncle&#8217;s little friend is a sparrow. I did not hear him tell the story about it on Sunday, but when I did, a day or two before, he said &#8220;it had been only a small speck of <hi rend="italic">slobber</hi>&#8221;! He, too, thinks this is the word he used.</p>
<p>We have a good many birds here,&#8212;robins, sparrows, &#38; some blackbirds; and last summer a nightingale used to make his &#8220;tender and strong&#8221; note heard quite close to us; a little robin built her nest in a tool house in the garden adjoining ours. Our neighbours left the window open so that she could always be free even when the door was closed, and thence she sent out nine little redbreasts to the world. They are disposed to be very friendly but we never become intimate because of the cat who usually follows me into the garden. If the poor little things reason about a personal devil, I am sure they must think of our cat and have no doubt about his existence.</p>
<p>My Uncle was much interested in what you said about Humboldt. He had missed the passage which you refer to.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. Ruskin,</salute></opener>
<p>I take the liberty of sending with this a note that has come tonight from Lady Lothian, who, as you will see, is anxious to have a nomination to the Blue Coat School, for a boy she is interested in. I do not know whether the lady is right in supposing that you have the power of nomination, but if you had and were willing to give the required promise for next year, you would be doing a kindness to one of the hardest-working and most self-denying people in the world.</p>
<p>I hardly know how to put into words the awful fact I have to communicate. I have failed utterly and ignominiously in any attempt to translate Uli into English. I have tried over and over again and can&#8217;t get on at all. It is written in cramped, foreign German, largely interspersed with Swiss words, which no dictionary will explain. My uncle has goaded me on with cruel jibes; but he read the book himself, and says now that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> could at no period of his life have translated it. I need say no more, except that I am much grieved to find what would have been a great pleasure to me so far beyond my very small powers.</p>
<p>You will be sorry to know that my uncle has been very weak and poorly of late weeks. He is, however, getting a little better as the weather improves.</p>
<closer><salute>He sends his kindest and best love to you; and I am ever, dear Mr. Ruskin,

<p>A strange and to me most blessed, continuance of truly natural &#38; sweet summer weather has kept me out nearly all day long,&#8212;though always your letter in my breast pocket, to be answered,&#8212; &#8220;tomorrow, at latest&#8221;.&#8212;Had my presentation been free I had answered at once it was given away months ago. The Ulrich is a more important matter. There is no reason whatever for you translating it from the German. If you can do it from the French; with notes on any German word you happen to know, it will be all I want. I am greatly set on having it done by you, with your Uncle&#8217;s help.</p>
<p>Your report of his health troubles me, but I think the change from that bitter weather to gentler, <hi rend="italic">seemed</hi> at first weakening to us all. I had a week when it first came fine&#8212;of extraordinary &#38; helpless lassitude.</p>
<p>Write me word soon again how he is, and whether you are both sick of Ulrich, or will try the French.</p>

<p>I am so thankful to hear from Mary that you are better. I have not been writing because I thought you would scarcely care to hear of my many failures and languid progresses; or of my &#8220;scientific&#8221; museum work, slowly organizing itself; but I think it will please you to hear that I have good hope now of recasting the Stones of Venice into a book such as you would have a pupil of yours write. I shall throw off at least half of the present text, and add what I now better know of the real sources of Venetian energy,&#8212;and what I&#8212;worse&#8212;know of the cause of Venetian ruin,&#8212;with some notes on modern Italy which I do eagerly hope you will be satisfied with. Only we must keep clear of Barbarossa!</p>
<p>And I trust you will like a bit of preface I&#8217;m writing for an edition of Sir Philip Sidney&#8217;s Psalter, bearing on the psalms before and after Leuther [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], and on sundry other musical &#8220;performances&#8221;&#8212;not paid for by spectacular managers. I have a great deal to think out about Scotch music, and song; partly with the help of Mary&#8217;s book,&#8212;as soon as I get a clear proof I&#8217;ll send you one.</p>
<p>I shall be here for a month at least, but hope to see you before going to Oxford in November.&#8212;And do not think, however seldom I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> now see you, that I am less your loving,</p>

<p>I have been much too sad to write, lately, but am so thankful to hear of you today from Joanna that I cannot but tell you so. I am so very lonely now, missing the father and mother more and more every day, and having no more anything to look forward to here, but the gradual closing in of all, and feeling, for you, with continually increasing respect &#38; love, more and more sorrow as I felt myself also entering with you the time of waiting, that what comfort I might otherwise have taken in telling you what I was doing quite left me. Also, I have been failing so utterly in keeping up to my plans, or fulfilling my promises,&#8212;so many things &#8220;gone to water&#8221; with the work done for them, that I have little heart for giving account of myself. I have an immense quantity of notes made for the life of Scott; and I had done much work in gathering the pieces I wanted of Frederick; and now here is another year gone, and nothing got into form, and new claims on me, it seems, from my own old work. For, coming here only to put myself into some temper of fancy, in recasting the Stones of Venice, I have got a new clue, utterly unseen by me when I wrote it, which will give, and ought to give me, many hours of added toil; but I believe I shall now leave the book a sound piece of work, and connect it with a short history of Venice for the schools of St. George, which I am not without hope will give you pleasure. I have sent a little piece to be printed, and will send you the first revise in any readable state. I shall keep close at it all this winter.</p>
<p>Also, concluding now the sixth year and volume of Fors, I am going in the seventh year, to gather it all into connected force, and drive it home, not any more enigmatically; but with literal and quiet advice to the men, what to do. First of all I shall take up the organization of food supply, then of clothes; getting actual answer or question from the Sheffield operatives on all principles. I have sent, through my secretary Mr. Tyrrwhitt, (Rev<sup>d</sup> R<sup>st</sup>J), a formal and careful interrogation to the Bishop of Manchester, whether he means to answer my challenge or not; and the same to Mr. Fawcett, and their replies shall be kept in the Sheffield Museum.</p>
<p>I must send this poor note to day. My love to Mary. Posta in Firma [?], Venezia, will always find me, if she has word of Ulrich to give me.</p>

<salute>Dearest Papa,</salute></opener>
<p>I am so thankful to hear from Mary that you are yourself again, and bright, and reading Shakespeare to her. What a blessed girl that is, to have you and another uncle to &#8220;do for,&#8221; and to able to do for them!&#8212;and to be witty and insighted besides; and have her uncle liking to read Shakespeare to her.</p>
<p>There is something left in &#8220;the Present&#8221; still, if we can get the mischief of it quieted&#8212;cocks not to crow except on properly far off dunghills &#38; so on.</p>
<p>Then it&#8217;s so nice having your beautiful letter to read. I didn&#8217;t mean to stay out this winter, and I&#8217;ve no Carlyle with me&#8212;not a bit&#8212;and I&#8217;ve been reading French novels instead with no benefit in the change.</p>
<p>All the same, I think if you will glance over two stories in an English-French one, which I told Joanna to get and will tell her to send to Cheyne Row&#8212;&#8220;Our New Bishop&#8221; and &#8220;A Hero of the Commune,&#8221;&#8212;you will find some good in them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very unhappy in my work here&#8212;I don&#8217;t want to write about Venice, now, but about Sheffield: and yet I think, I ought to finish rightly what I have done so much of, and dot all the i&#8217;s. I get in a fury because whenever I come to the original statement of anything it&#8217;s always a reference to a MS. in the Vatican&#8212;or the like.</p>
<p>Fancy, papa, what times you and I should have had if those beasts of aristocrats, instead of spending all their money in horses, had set up printing presses, and printed all the first documents of their own history (the worthless dishwashing that they are)&#8212;and nice Indexes!</p>
<p>Please give my love to Froude, and impart the above idea to him. I&#8217;m a little proud of it, because it&#8217;s the first time it ever occurred to me what printing was good for.</p>
<p>Love to Mary, and thank her for her letter, and say, I rather like that notion of the bursting bubble&#8212;only I fear it&#8217;s more like a bursting balloon&#8212;with small chance for the car.</p>
<p>Forgive my ill writing. I&#8217;ve tried so hard to do better but it&#8217;s not in me.</p>

<p>All good and dear wishes are with you and your uncle from me, always&#8212;but so much has been happening I can&#8217;t tell you, yet awhile, but it will interest your uncle much I think.

<salute>My dear Mary,</salute></opener>
<p>I am so very glad of your letter, and laurel leaf.&#8212;It comes with benediction to me&#8212;for truly, the horses of St. Mark&#8217;s are I think putting on their harness for me,&#8212;and I do hope you uncle will like some of the harness-bronze, in next Fors.</p>
<p>My dear love to him. I&#8217;m so thankful you&#8217;ve taken poor Alice home again. Nobody, you will find, can do him, but&#8212;great and simple people&#8212;Not that you&#8217;re very &#8220;simple&#8221; neither! I&#8217;m glad to hear of the Elwins. But my dear, I will answer your question in a word&#8212;&#8220;No one should ever write a biography, or paint a picture in Hatred.&#8221;</p>
<p>I do not intend to write a biography of John Stewart [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Mill, nor should Mr. Elwin have written one of Pope. He has done quite limitless mischief to the cause of all truth. How he was so Godabandoned as to do it, he will find out some day, being good at heart as you tell me.</p>

<salute>My dearest Papa,</salute></opener>
<p>This was my dead Papa&#8217;s birthday, and he will like me to write to you. I should, often, if I were in good heart: but my work here is full of discouragements keeping me silent. Also I&#8217;ve rather been expecting some little compliment from you on something or other in Fors, and have been chilled by getting none; lastly, I have been reading Frederick right through, with care, and am a little vexed;&#8212;I don&#8217;t like him as well as I did. His treatment of his brother after the Zittau business seems to me quite brutal &#8212;and I am <hi rend="italic">entirely</hi> vexed at finding him always speaking of himself and Prussia, never of the <hi rend="italic">interests of Silesia</hi>. I am very thankful for your letter in Times on the &#8220;Interests of England.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8212;That Pottery, field <hi rend="italic">chiefly</hi>, the buildings very shabby I believe&#8212;I&#8217;ve never seen it!!!&#8212;is&#8212;and will be, mine.</p>

<salute>Dearest Papa,</salute></opener>
<p>I know you don&#8217;t care quite so much as foolish I do for Walter Scott&#8212;But please don&#8217;t think it saucy of me then, to write you this with his pen, which the Master of Harrow D. Butler has lent me.&#8212;It&#8217;s to thank you for&#8212;ever so many things&#8212;but lastly for bringing that youth to see you, (the Hon<sup>e</sup> Alfred Lyttleton, of Trinity, Cambridge)&#8212;I can&#8217;t come yet for ten days or so, but then, I shall be so happy to be by the fireside again. And now, please, for this is my chief business, make that sweet Mary tell me a little of what you would have me say in next Fors&#8212;of <hi rend="italic">anything</hi>.</p>

<salute>My dearest Papa,</salute></opener>
<p>I have not written to you, because my illness broke me all to pieces, and every little bit has a different thing to say,&#8212;which makes it difficult in the extreme to write to any one whom wants to tell things to, just as they are, and who cares very truly whether they are right or wrong. It was utterly wonderful to me to find that I could go so heartily and headily mad; for you know I had been priding myself on peculiar sanity! And it was more wonderful yet to find the madness made up into things so dreadful, out of things so trivial. One of the most provoking and disagreeable of the spectres was developed out of the firelight on my mahogany bedpost&#8212;and my fate, for all futurity, seemed continually to turn on the humour of dark personages who were materially nothing but the stains of damp on the ceiling. But the sorrowfullest part of the matter was, and is, that, while my illness at Matlock encouraged me by all its dreams in after work, this one has done nothing but humiliate and terrify me; and leaves me nearly unable to speak any more except of the natures of stones and flowers.</p>
<p>I have regained great part of my strength, and am not in bad <hi rend="italic">spirits</hi>,&#8212;on the condition, otherwise absolutely essential, that I think of nothing that would vex me. But this means a very trifling form of thought and direction of work, throughout the day.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I am working out some points in the history and geography of Arabia which I think will be useful, and reading you, and Gibbon! alternately&#8212;or Mahomet! I am going to stigmatize Gibbon&#8217;s as the worst style of language ever yet invented by man&#8212;its affectation and platitude being both comsummate. It is like the most tasteless water-gruel, with a handful of Epsom salts strewed in for flowers, and served with the airs of being turtle. Has Mary done any more Gotthelf&#8212;I never read him without renewed refreshment.</p>
<p>By the way, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are very unsatisfactory about Mahomet&#8217;s death,&#8212;which I want to know all that may be known of; and also, in re-reading <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, the first book I got to, after I got my natural eyes again, I was worried of questions in his life&#8212;how far it was good for Silesia to be Prussian or Austrian&#8212;whether Silesia itself is Prussian or Austrian tempered&#8212;and how its geography marks its relations to south and north. I might make out this from detached passages; but the great impression left on me was, how blessed it would have been for Silesia, Prussia, and Austria, if all their soldiers, generals &#38; Princes had been made at the first outbreak of the war one grand auto da fe [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of, in the style of&#8212;my recent scenic effects deduced from damp in the ceiling.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t come today&#8212;it was so cold in the train, yesterday, it took all the life out of me; and I&#8217;ve been forced to rest&#8212;and now I&#8217;ve no day till Tuesday, when I can come, I hope, whenever you would like me.</p>

<p>And did you come here&#8212;yourself&#8212;actually &#8212;you dearest, kindest papa&#8212;to see your poor unfilial prodigal?&#8212;Oh me, I&#8217;m always being routed about by the pigs&#8212;(not that I mean that, I mean by pigs everything that&#8217;s bad)&#8212;and can&#8217;t get away. I&#8217;ve been working&#8212;as I never thought to do again&#8212;against time lately&#8212;and have been writing letters to my clerical friends&#8212;e.g., grey pamphlet sent with this I hope&#8212;and a quantity of talk besides&#8212;as useless probably&#8212;about pictures, which you&#8217;ll get on Monday, and I hope to go over myself early in the week to get some forgiveness and blessing from you.</p>
<p>Very good it was of Froude to come too&#8212;after what I&#8217;ve been writing to him&#8212;but certainly the Devil&#8217;s got into him lately&#8212;though he&#8217;s still himself all but that contents.</p>
