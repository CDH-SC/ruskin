            <p> A rain as of April has fallen – </p>
            <p>Hennie’s heart is broken to Herod. </p>
            <p>We work together; Bernhard is on the </p>
            <p>high seas, <unclear>Fuk</unclear><unclear>Shope</unclear>, is still reading </p>
            <p>his Sonnet, &amp; the clothes of spring </p>
            <p>have been arriving post on post. </p>
            <p>I am happy after an arid, desperate </p>

            <p>One afternoon I recall.</p>
            <p>It is Wednesday, &amp;, as one abandoned </p>
            <p>of hope I am curled up on my bed</p>

            <p>while I wrestle into my Albrect Dürer </p>
            <p>gown.</p>
            <p> The talk is chiefly of <hi rend="underline">Don Giovanni</hi> – </p>
            <p>but in truth we meet to wail.</p>
            <p> With Painter it is a season of </p>
            <p>absolute barrenness – he is lying low. </p>
            <p>I tell him I shall say to Bernhard </p>
            <p>“There is not a sign of him” left, “Not </p>
            <p>a sign” he murmurs, “When Bern-</p>
            <p>-hard is by – I am in eclipse.”</p>
            <p> I amuse him from a heart, dropping </p>
            <p>like a stalactite-cave.</p>

            <p>Shannon’s beauty, his sweet </p>
            <p>mouth (“He hasn’t got one at </p>

            <p>“No – ”</p>

            <p>is disquieting – there is something </p>
            <p>paralytic about it. And it is </p>

            <p>Such primroses from Janet Dodge!</p>
            <p>I have written:</p>
            <p>A fresh &amp; immediate note of thanks </p>
            <p>for the primroses, dear Janet. </p>
            <p>Among the difficult Arts of </p>

            <p>of gathering &amp; presenting primroses </p>
            <p>is scarcely ever learnt. Janet </p>
            <p>is perfect in it. One usually </p>
            <p>receives primroses with a sense </p>
            <p>of nervous prostration, such </p>
            <p>as a picture-gallery produces; </p>
            <p>&amp; with an inarticulate hatred </p>
            <p>for the giver. But I lift out of </p>
            <p>an orderly box little separate </p>
            <p>nosegays, their tender stems, </p>
            <p>that always make me think </p>
            <p>of the feet of Arab girls that </p>
            <p>have the heels &amp; nails flushed </p>
            <p>with henna, all ready to be </p>
            <p>dipped in water. I bring out </p>
            <p>the great ivory Leeds bowl, </p>
            <p>I set the primroses' feet to </p>
            <p>shine under its deep bath; &amp; </p>
            <p>there are the primroses in their </p>
            <p>orient yellow, giving out their </p>
            <p>languid perfume. – sweet girls, </p>
            <p>but not to me of the West.</p>
            <p>I bless Janet &amp; so will Michael </p>

            <p>I had an excited sense of </p>
            <p>panic – Continually, like </p>
            <p>a general on the field I had </p>
            <p>to give responsible orders to </p>
            <p>my unfeeling limbs.</p>
            <p>Bed after three days seemed </p>
            <p>to do no good – Only when </p>
            <p>I first got up did the </p>
            <p>gaunt queerness of my </p>
            <p>state make me weep </p>
            <p>at first. The fatigue of </p>
            <p>that generalship! Should </p>
            <p>I always be at the point </p>
            <p>of battle? Should I never </p>
            <p>let the will act unconsciously </p>
            <p>I could make my unfeeling </p>
            <p>feet dance – but the dance </p>
            <p>was to me that of winter </p>
            <p>thistle-down.</p>
            <p>Cheer quickly came back – Were </p>

            <p>He is disappointed in Sabbatai – </p>
            <p>because he conceives Rénan’s </p>
            <p>Jesus, repeated dramatically in the </p>
            <p>central actions of his life. He would </p>
            <p>even have the cock crow thrice. He </p>

            <p>disillusion when Jerusalem was </p>

            <p>failure.</p>
            <p> But we have not touched that divine </p>

            <p> Painter has always felt profoundly </p>
            <p>the tragedy of Christ – he would have </p>
            <p>liked our Sabbatai to have something </p>
            <p>of his richness of allure, his tenderness. </p>
            <p>This was not in our scope.</p>
            <p>We speak of Rossetti. “You are like him –” </p>
            <p>“No, Michael, Rossetti was one of the original </p>
            <p>minds of his time. I am not that. </p>
            <p>I am a spectator, doubled by the actor. </p>
            <p>That means I am a critic. </p>
            <p>I am the greatest spectator I have </p>
            <p>ever known”. Of his painting he will not </p>
            <p>speak, but much of <del>its</del> his life, in its </p>
            <p>current of change &amp; fate –</p>
            <p> He likes the Palace, it is not hostile to </p>
            <p>him. He likes its sense of solidity – that </p>
            <p>storms do not shake it. And he likes the </p>
            <p>mid-night landscape from those high </p>
            <p>windows – Kensington Gardens he </p>
            <p>does <hi rend="underline">not</hi> like.</p>
            <p>There are brief glances of Henry – </p>

                        perspective, e.g., by lowering the horizon in order to create a sense of
                        greater monumentality. His flinty, metallic landscapes and somewhat stony
                        figures give evidence of a fundamentally sculptural approach to

            <p>Amy leaves us, after an affectionate, </p>

            <p>There is rain about, &amp; rain over </p>
            <p>downs is stealthiness over solitude. </p>
            <p>One is haunted.</p>

            <p>the ground, as it seems, of the </p>
            <p>tall grasses, takes its place. </p>
            <p>The great downs are tawny or </p>
            <p>dove – they lie so soft &amp; wide. </p>
            <p>Here one learns that solitude </p>
            <p>has wings – they are stretched </p>
            <p>out here, where she sleeps – </p>
            <p>we can measure their </p>

            <p>that . . . . well, anticlimax </p>

            <p>ends the scene – self-same with </p>

            <p>&amp; myrrhs &amp; odorous gums – </p>

            <p>As we came to it in the evening </p>
            <p>its fragrance is solid before us.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Francis is back from Bank. He claims to have </p>
            <p>laid the Spectre. No such name as </p>
            <p>Culter is or has been known. And the </p>

            <p>Cutler (even this re-arrangement </p>

            <p>The Second Sunday</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>The top story of Paragon is finished. </p>
            <p>We have heard that Bernhard has </p>
            <p>been called to Paris on business. </p>
            <p>So <del>not</del><add>no</add> Forest meeting! There is </p>
            <p>such a small element of </p>
            <p>Time in my relation with him </p>
            <p>I scarcely feel this check. We </p>
            <p>reached the perfect moment </p>
            <p>ten days ago &amp; within the </p>
            <p><del>radious</del> radius of its perfection </p>
            <p>all time is included. Had he </p>
            <p>come fretted to the Forest – had </p>
            <p>he come conjoined, not his </p>
            <p>single self, all my future </p>
            <p>might have become temporal, </p>
            <p>that is now infinite.</p>
            <p>He returns Tommy’s Poems </p>
            <p>unrepentant – he still feels as if </p>
            <p>they were rather promising, but </p>
            <p>hopelessly unmusical exercises. </p>
            <p>The utmost they extract from him </p>
            <p>is a certain consent, but with </p>
            <p>no warmth.</p>
            <p>The last criticism is merited to a </p>
            <p>degree – Tommy’s hateful mind chills </p>
            <p>the creativeness of his emotion. </p>
            <p>But his work is not promising – </p>
            <p>it is <hi rend="underline">performance</hi> – it is </p>
            <p>a little satyr of Pan, not a little </p>

            <p>We are getting happy in our Forest. </p>

            <p> </p>

            <p> </p>

                The Artists </p>
            <p>dined with us. Mary had got </p>
            <p>up a Bach afternoon, &amp; Fay &amp; </p>

            <p>difficult great music had wrought </p>
            <p>Fay to nervous fatigue &amp; headache. </p>
            <p>He looked white, as if dying </p>
            <p>in mind, at his arrival, though </p>
            <p>he was so excited he poured out </p>
            <p>a stream of talk on Bach. </p>
            <p>A prelude he heard was like </p>
            <p>the outpouring of a bag of </p>
            <p>jewels – dusk, with here &amp; </p>
            <p>there one flash to measure </p>
            <p>the wealth of the cold gem-</p>
            <p>cascade. Bach composes on the </p>
            <p>brain itself, his music is organic </p>
            <p>only on that instrument – as </p>
            <p>some music is only organic on </p>
            <p>the heart, or the nerve-centres. </p>
            <p>He is the most taxing of all </p>
            <p>musicians – his high demand is </p>
            <p>almost of super-human quality. </p>
            <p>When we dine the heat &amp; the </p>
            <p>festive dishes, meeting Bach in </p>
            <p>the poor Painter’s body, produce </p>
            <p>a deadness of nausea – we </p>
            <p>quite fear the worst. But he revives.</p>

            <p> A great letter from Painter –</p>
            <p>– Oh, enchanting!</p>
            <p>In response to a letter from Michael, </p>
            <p>in which she said the real meaning </p>
            <p>of Christ’s saying “Depart from me, </p>
            <p>ye that work iniquity!” was </p>
            <p>“Depart all ye that are out of </p>
            <p>touch with me” – Painter comes </p>
            <p>into magnetic touch with the </p>
            <p>Poet.</p>
            <p>“I have news. I have turned </p>

            <p>I write to Painter</p>
            <p> This is of the god! It is subtle, </p>
            <p>irresistible; it does not answer to the words<unclear>: </unclear></p>

            <p>a ruffle among the angels.</p>
            <p> Henry &amp; I go over the “to-morrow” list. </p>
            <p> Henry broods over the drinking Sphinx, </p>
            <p>but all my love – &amp; all the foxity of my <unclear>life</unclear></p>

            <p>I speak not: speech is not for that wh. can </p>
            <p>be wrought.</p>
            <p> Could you, Painter, I wonder, be some </p>
            <p>year happy in the forest for a day or </p>
            <p>two? Could you be patient to learn </p>
            <p>the tongue of the moss, &amp; all the accents </p>
            <p>of the trees? Henry knows not. I wonder.</p>
            <p> I would far rather you were at the </p>
            <p>Palace with your clay. Painter, you have </p>
            <p>been called by one who is not your enemy, </p>
            <p>“an abstract eel”, &amp; this too is for me your </p>

            <p>is far better than “joy with economy.”</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>I cannot turn to the Forest now that </p>
            <p>you have set me on the track </p>
            <p>of art, – &amp; yet there is a cherry-tree </p>
            <p>the poets wake to at dawn – kaleidoscopic </p>
            <p>in its light through pointed leaves, – </p>
            <p>where the birds &amp; they remember the </p>
            <p>cherry-harvest – &amp; twitter in their old </p>
            <p>age of song; and there is the strange </p>
            <p>reddening &amp; re-budding of the summer </p>
            <p>oaks, &amp; shakings, &amp; droppings, &amp; sounds.</p>

            <p>The webs lie on the heath like </p>

            <p>This afternoon we have driven </p>
            <p>in the by-ways at the heart of </p>
            <p>the Forest, as never before. </p>
            <p>Not a high-road, except for a </p>
