      This is a pilot and a work in progress. Transcription is being undertaken by a team from around the globe and the site will be updated as it is completed; fuller editorial notes will be added over time; the functionality of the site will develop gradually too. The digitization of the diaries of Michael Field is a scholarly community project, supported by a technical team led and funded by the University of South Carolina. We are a group of students, scholars, and professors, led by Marion Thain who range from experts in nineteenth-century literature to interested novices. There will be mistakes and there will be information missing in the transcription presented here. As a user of this resource you are part of our community; we welcome you, and we are pleased to offer this work-in-progress to you. In return we ask you to help us improve it by emailing the volume leads with any corrections or relevant additional information you might have (see their names given in the ‘Project Team’ section below). Thank you for visiting, and thank you for being part of the project.

    <p>
      The poets, dramatists, and diarists Katharine Bradley (1846-1914) and Edith Cooper (1862- 1913) were not only aunt and niece, but also long-term partners who wrote collaboratively under the composite name ‘Michael Field’. Michael Field published prolifically—particularly collections of lyric poetry and historical verse-dramas—finding success with the early works in the 1880s, and winning new-found fame in recent times primarily with the poetry. However, perhaps their most fascinating document, in material terms, is the diary Bradley and Cooper co-wrote to record their lives and literary endeavors. Titled "Works and Days," it primarily covers the years from 1888 to their deaths just prior to World War I. Intended for posthumous publication, their literary executor (Thomas Sturge Moore) published in 1933 a vastly expurgated volume of extracts. Currently housed in the archives of the British Library, and untranscribed, the full manuscript diary has been relatively inaccessible to anyone other than the dedicated scholar. Yet it contains much to intrigue researchers and general readers alike. In addition to their own aesthetic response to events both contemporaneous and historically-resonant, it offers powerful historical documentation of the construction of a queer identity through the formation of their aesthetic paganism, their conversion to Catholicism, and, finally, through the pathos of Cooper’s death. It also tells the narrative of their close, if often tempestuous, relationships with John Ruskin, Robert Browning, and Bernhard Berenson; and their chronicle of the cultural life of fin-de-siècle London and Europe, detailing encounters with the leading literary and artistic figures of the period, including Oscar Wilde, William Butler Yeats, Algernon Charles Swinburne, and Walter Pater. The writing is powerful, caustic, witty, and sometimes intensely moving.

    <br>
    <p>
      The scanning of the complete diaries of Michael Field has been made possible by New York University and the British Library. The platform is hosted, built and digitally served by the Center for Digital Humanities at the University of South Carolina. Other partners are contributing grants to fund transcription work and they will be acknowledged here as the relevant transcription is added.
