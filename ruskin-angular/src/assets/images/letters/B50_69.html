Its general principles and primary facts are now as certain as those of astronomy, but of </span>—<span style="font-size:12pt">Central fire we as yet know nothing.  You shall look at stones, and give them a </span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic">time</span><span style="font-size:12pt">, and see what will come out of them for you, in your own way. I know you will find them interesting. But all the books are dismal, yet full of good work. I will stay in any day for you after Friday. You are sure to catch me before I go out any day, if you are as early as one.</span>

    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">It breaks my heart to get such a letter from you, yet it is quite like you— very monumental of you— Only how could you think I did not understand your emphasis— I know how you feel things, and that what you were feeling was right, though you had not had time to see other things in the picture. What is that between thee &amp; me?— Well, of course I’ll come; but could not Mrs. Carlyle and you come here.— You see, if I ask you to dinner my mother will make a state-matter of it—and fatigue herself with thinking of all dishes on and out of the earth— If you will come earlier, &amp; stay dinner by surprise good; but I think the best way would be to drive over her about ½ past six, to tea, &amp; for chat in evening. Could you do this— would you like it? Then I’ll come for another goodbye chat—at Chelsea—Any day would do for us except tomorrow?</span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">Dearest Mr. Carlyle, </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">I should indeed have written to you, as you bade me—long ago, if it had not been that I had nothing to say except either what you knew very well—(that I loved you—and because I did, was glad, for the time, I had lost you)—or—what it would have made you very angry with me to know. Which, as it must be told, may well now be at once got confessed. Namely, that one day—soon after you left—I sat down gravely to consider what I could say about poetry, and finding after a forenoon that the sum of my labours amounted to four sentences, with the matter of two in them, that also my hands were hot—and my lips parched—and my heart heavy—I concluded that it was not the purpose of fate that I should lose any more days in such a manner, and wrote to the Oxford people a final and formal farewell.</span><span id="ftn39_return"><a class="notelink" title="Letter 69.

    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">For which they have graciously expressed pretty regrets: but I have since felt none—except those which related to the letter I had some day to write to Mentone.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">One pleasant thing I had to tell you of, however, was a most happy evening we had with your sister.</span><span id="ftn40_return"><a class="notelink" title="Carlyle’s sister Jean (Mrs. James Aitken, of Dumphries), who was taking care of the Carlyle house in Chelsea at the time. She was the mother of Mary A…" href="#ftn40"><sup>40</sup></a></span><span style="font-size:12pt">  I think she enjoyed it too.  My mother was entirely happy with her at once, and my cousin rejoiced in her, and I rejoiced in all three.  Her modest gentleness of </span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic">power</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> is notable to me above anything I have yet seen of womankind.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">She saved a little bit of Frederick the Great from the housemaid—and sent it me—for which I am ever her grateful servant.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">  She told me a little thing that touched me closely also—that you had thought it worth while to keep—labelled—that little scrawl of curved lines I made one evening. And I think I shall be able to show you, when you return, that my poor little gift, such as it is, </span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic">does</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> lie in eye and hand—not in brains—for, since I finally gave up the Oxford matter, I set myself (chiefly to put some too painful thoughts from me) to do in painting one or two little things as well as I could.  (Which I never did before—for all my drawing hitherto has only been to collect data—never for its own sake.)  And, doing as well as I could, I have done—not ill—several things—a dead partridge, and a wild drake, and a small twisted shell.  That sounds despicable enough, I fear, to you in your olive woods at the feet of Witches of Endor;—nevertheless, poor as it may be, I think it </span> <span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic">is </span><span style="font-size:12pt">my work. For, Turner being dead, I am quite sure there is no one else in England now who could have painted that shell, but I; and it seems to me, therefore, I must have been meant to do it.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">  I need not say how happy the kind sentence about your wishing to have me again on Wednesday evenings made me. Nevertheless, I must still unselfishly pray that you may be enchanted away by magical “hair of the head”—to Florence at least, if not to Rome.  That satiety of travel is surely a kind of lichenous overgrowing of one’s thoughts when one has been </span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic">too</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> long at rest—very good for most people, if they would only have patience to take the colouring—but surely not for you?  I think your interest in seeing would increase the more you were tempted to see, and that the mere change of air and of slope of sunray, by whatever endurance of irksome motion obtained, would be—of—so much better for you than the monotonous effluvium of Chelsea shore. The fog was so dark to-day that I had candles at nine o’clock breakfast.  Think of that! and look up to your sky “with recognition.”</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">My mother thanks you much for your good message. I hope to have some interesting little gossip to write to you about my cousin, next week.</span><span id="ftn41_return"><a class="notelink" title="In Ruskin’s diary for Feburary 23 (Diaries, II, 611) he wrote “Saturday.

          <p class="footnote text">Years later, in a letter to C.E. Norton on October 7, 1884, Ruskin made a revealing comment on the frequency of the phrase’s appearance in Carlyle’s letters and speech. “The world’s made up of morts and disses,” he said, “and it’s no use always saying ‘ay de mi’ like Carlyle. I’m really ashamed of him in those letters to Emerson. My own diaries are indeed full of mewing and moaning all to myself, but I think my letters try to be pleasant.” (C.E.

          <p class="footnote text">Carlyle, writing to Jane from Scotland twelve days later, refers to Ruskin’s gift, and makes an interesting comment on it. “Ruskin’s <span style="font-style:italic">Sesame and Lilies</span>,” he said, “must be a pretty little thing. Trollope, in reviewing it with considerable insolence and stupidity and vulgarity, produces little specimens far beyond any Trollope sphere of speculation.” (T. Bliss, <span style="font-style:italic">Thomas Carlyle’s Letters to His </span>Wife [1953], p. 381.) On pp. 404-5 of her book, Bliss has an extract of Trollope’s review, which sheds some light on Carlyle’s description. Trollope, after claiming that Ruskin’s words do not contain Carlyle’s “innate wisdom” and have “no definite tendency,” goes on to lament Ruskin’s “desire to preach sermons instead of making music with his bow,” and wishes Ruskin would return to writing about art.</p>

          <p class="footnote text">Ruskin’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Ethics of Dust </span>was first issued in December of 1865. Cast in the form of a dialogue between a kindly visiting lecturer (Ruskin) and an audience of young girls at Winnington school, the book is purportedly about crystals, but Ruskin’s imaginative style carries him into the realms of the past, dreams, mythology, and social criticism. The “Egypt<sup>n</sup> mythology” Carlyle mentions refers to Lecture II of the book, “The Pyramid Builders,” which contains Ruskin’s account of his dreams about Egyptian gods and goddesses—especially Neit and Ptah—and has three lengthy notes about the origins and meanings of these deities.</p>
          <p class="footnote text">Some of the “faults” Carlyle may have discussed with Ruskin after his “first feeling” can be found in a letter to his brother John on December 21: “I have been reading a strange little Xmas Book of Ruskin’s called <span style="font-style:italic">Ethics of the Dust</span>,” he said, “it is all <span style="font-style:italic">abt. </span>crystallography; and seems to be, or is, geologically well-informed and correct; but it twists <span style="font-style:italic">symbolically</span>, in the strangest way, all its Geology into Morality, Theology, Egyptian Mythology, (with fiery cuts at Political Economy, etc!)—pretending not to know whether the forces and destinies and behaviours of crystals are not very like those of men! Wonderful to behold. Apart from this sad weakness of <span style="font-style:italic">backbone</span>, the Book is full of admirable talent: with such a faculty of <span style="font-style:italic">expression </span>in it (or of picturing what is meant) as beats all living rivals.” (Froude IV, 298 and MS: NLS, 526.35.)</p>

          <p class="footnote text">Jane Welsh Carlyle had died on April 21, 1866. On the afternoon of that day Ruskin had come to Chelsea to call on Mrs. Carlyle, bringing flowers, only to be met at the door with news of her death. On April 24 Ruskin left England for a tour of his Continent with Lord and Lady Trevelyan, and he had reached Dijon on May 4. His diary says “I write to Mr. Carlyle” on May 6 (see <span style="font-style:italic">Diaries</span>, II, 587). This May 6 letter has not been found, but it is obviously the one Carlyle refers to here.</p>
          <p class="footnote text">Carlyle’s reference to Ruskin’s “unhappy” state is probably a reference to Ruskin’s alarming symptoms, since it was at this time that Ruskin first experienced fits of giddiness and clouded vision. It may also be a reference to Lady Trevelyan’s declining health, for she was to die on May13. The grief that Ruskin felt over the loss of both women was a deep and genuine one, as Carlyle knew, and some indication of it can be found in a letter from Ruskin to Rawdon Brown on June 11: “The deaths of Mrs. Carlyle and of Lady Trevelyan take from me my two best women friends of older power; and I am not very zealous about anything,” he said (<span style="font-style:italic">Works, </span>XXXVI, 509).</p>

          <p class="footnote text">This letter, and the three following it, deal with the “Eyre Defense Committee.” In October 1865, a small uprising of blacks in Jamaica was suppressed with great speed and destruction by the governor of the island, Edward John Eyre. Soon a committee, led by John Stuart Mill, T. H. Huxley, Thomas Hughes, Charles Darwin, John Bright, Herbert Spencer and Goldwin Smith, was formed to denounce and prosecute Eyre as an incompetent tyrant and murdered who violated the natural rights of all English subjects. Eyre was recalled to England and put on trial before Parliament. Carlyle, who had little sympathy for democracy, had already written disparagingly of the Jamaican natives in <span style="font-style:italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets </span>(see his <span style="font-style:italic">Works</span>, XX, 25-27; and XXIX, 355-57), and looked upon Eyre as a hero who had resolutely stopped a potentially dangerous rebellion. In the late summer and early fall of 1866, he helped form the Eyre Defense Committee, and served as its first chairman. He enlisted the aid of Charles Kingsley, Tennyson, Dickens and Ruskin, whose speech in defense of Eyre can be found in his <span style="font-style:italic">Works</span>, XVIII, 552. Eyre was eventually acquitted, but was not allowed to return to his post in Jamaica. See Introduction. See also Bernard Semmel, <span style="font-style:italic">The Governor Eyre Controversy </span>(1962); G. H. Ford, “The Governor Eyre Case in England,” <span style="font-style:italic">UTQ, </span>XVII (1947-48) 219-33; and Gillian Workman, “Thomas Carlyle and the Governor Eyre Controversy: An Account with Some New Material,” VS, XVIII, no.1 (September 1974), 77-102.</p>

          <p class="footnote text">In 1862, Eyre had been peripherally involved in an attempt by a colonial engineer to embezzle government funds during the construction of a tramway in Jamaica. George Price, a member of Eyre’s executive committee, had persuaded Eyre to prosecute the engineer by threatening to send a letter to the Duke of Newcastle exposing the whole affair. According to Semmel (<span style="font-style:italic">The Governor Eyre Controversy</span>, p.112), Price wrote to Ruskin in September 1866, and gave all the information on the tramway episode. It is obviously these letter that have been shown to Carlyle.</p>
