    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">My Dearest Papa,</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">Yesterday evening I was climbing among the ravines of marble to the south; and came on a cottage like a Highland one—for roughness of look—only the mountain path winding round beneath it, went under a roof of vines trellised from its eaves, and opened before it entered the darkness of green leaves, into a golden threshing floor—the real “area” of the Latins. That so few people past [</span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic">sic</span><span style="font-size:12pt">] that the people could make their threshing floor of the path, was the first deep prettiness of it.  Then, they </span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic">had </span><span style="font-size:12pt">been threshing and winnowing—the little level field was soft with chaff. The marble rocks—bright gray—came down steep into it, as at Loch Katrine</span><span id="ftn1_return"><a class="notelink" title="Letter 160. MS: NLS, 556.95.

    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">I crossed the threshing floor, and met the peasant under his vines, looking pale and worn—the Lucchese “Good even Signoria, [</span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic">sic</span><span style="font-size:12pt">]” given with more than usual gentleness.  I said to him what I thought of his happy place,—as well as I could.  Yes, he said, but it was a “very dry” country.  “The olives had no fruit this year—see—the berries had all fallen, withered for want of rain.  For want of </span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic">water</span><span style="font-size:12pt">, yes, I said—why don’t you catch it on the hillside, before it runs to the Serchio and the sea?

    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">Meantime, while he is proving that the most intelligibly more poet of England lied about his letters, Mr Elwin goes up into his pulpit every 7</span><sup style="font-size:12pt">th</sup><span style="font-size:12pt"> day, to tell his congregation that such and such things are so, concerning God and his ways.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">Now, if he tells them one word more, positively, than Pope has written in his universal prayer—He tells them—what is in all probability a lie—at least what no man living can prove to be true—and he tells them this, assuming to be a messenger from God.

The “Fors” that Ruskin thanks Mary for reading may be letter 40, written in April 1874. It has a long note defending Pope against Elwin, and its argument follows the one expressed above (<span style="font-style:italic">Works</span>, XXVIII, 76): “He [Pope] cringed—yes—to his friends;…to how many more than their friends do average clergymen cringe?...and for lying—any average partisan of religious dogma tells more lies in his pulpit in defence of what in his heart he knows to be indefensible, on any given Sunday, than Pope did in his whole life.

          <p class="footnote text">Ruskin had opened a tea shop on Paddington Street in London, designed to supply his customers with pure tea at a very low price. He put it in the care of two of his mother’s old servants, and debated on the color of the shop sign at great length in <span style="font-style:italic">Fors Clavigera</span>, letter 48 (<span style="font-style:italic">Works</span>, XXVIII, 246). In this letter to Mary Aitken, Ruskin enclosed a business card, which reads “Mr. Ruskin’s Teashop, kept/by Lucy and Harriet Tovy / <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Tea and Coffee Dealer</span>/ 29 Paddington Street, W.” The shop did little business however, and finally closed when one of the old servants died.</p>

How glad we ought to be that we have him still among us! It vexes me so, that the whole nation does not show its pride and delight in him, before he is gone. We have still a king in the earth and we take no notice of him…” The “word of advice” may be found in <span style="font-style:italic">Good Words</span>, XXXIII (1892), 460, where a letter from Carlyle to Miss Atkinson, written on October 29, 1866, is printed.
