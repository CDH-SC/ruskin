      <p class="Normal" style="text-align:left; ">Dear Ruskin, -- </p>
      <p class="Normal" style="text-align:left; ">I did not know yesterday till your servant was gone that there was any note in the parcel; nor at all what a feat you had done! A loan of the gallant young man’s memoirs<span id="ftn3_return"><a class="notelink" title="Probably a reference to Sir Herbert Edwardes (1819-68), who, as a young lieutenant, had bravely led English troops to victory at Kinyeri, India, in 18…" href="#ftn3"><sup>3</sup></a></span> was what I was expected; and here, in the most chivalrous style, comes a gift of them. This, I think, must be in the style <span style="font-style:italic">prior</span> to the Renaissance! What can I do but accept your kindness with pleasure and gratitude, though it is far beyond my deserts? Perhaps the next man I meet will use me as much below them; and so bring matters straight again! Truly I am much obliged, and return you many hearty thanks.</p>
      <p class="Normal" style="text-align:left; ">I was already deep in the “Stones;”<span id="ftn4_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ruskin’s The Stones of Venice, volume I, published in March 1851. For “Sermon in Stones,” see Shakespeare’s As You Like It, II.i.17: “Sermons in stone…" href="#ftn4"><sup>4</sup></a></span> and clearly purpose to hold on there. A strange, unexpected, and I believe, most true and excellent <span style="font-style:italic">Sermon</span> in Stones—as well as the best piece of School-mastering in Architectonics; from which I hope to learn in great many ways. The spirit and purport of these Critical Studies of yours are a singular sign of the times to me, and a very gratifying one. Right good speed to you, and victorious arrival on the farther shore! —It is a quite new “renaissance” I believe, we are getting into just now: either into final death, and the murk of Gehenna<span id="ftn5_return"><a class="notelink" title="Gehenna, one of Carlyle’s favorite words, refers to the valley of Hinnom, near Jerusalem.

A dreadful process, but a needful and inevitable one; nor do I doubt at all which way the issue will be, though which of the extant nations are to get included in it, and which to be trampled out and abolished in the process, may be very doubtful. God is great: --and sure enough, the changes in the Construction of Sheepfolds, as well as in other things, will require to be very considerable! —</p>
      <p class="Normal" style="text-align:left; ">We are still laboring under the foul kind of influenza here, I not far from emancipated, my poor wife still deep in the business, though I hope past the deepest. Am I to understand that you, too, are seized? In a day or two I hope to ascertain that you are well again. –Adieu: here is an interruption, here also is the end of the paper.</p>

      <p class="Normal" style="text-align:left; ">People are continually accusing me of borrowing other men’s thoughts, &amp; not confessing the obligation. I don’t think there is anything of which ‘I am more utterly incapable than of this meanness—but it is very difficult always to know how much one is I debted to other people—and it is always most difficult to explain to others the degree in which a stronger mind may guide you—without having at least intentionally, borrowed this or the other definite thought.<span id="ftn8_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ruskin had been accused, for instance of borrowing from Pugin, in an anonymous review of The Stones of Venice in The Ecclesiologist, XI (August 1851),…" href="#ftn8"><sup>8</sup></a></span> The fact is, it is very possible for two people to hit <span style="font-style:italic">sometimes</span> on the same thought—and I have over and over again been somewhat vexed as well as surprised at finding that what I really <span style="font-style:italic">had </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">knew</span> I had, worked out for myself, corresponded very closely to things that you had said much better. I entreat you not to think when (if you have ever patience to do so) you glance at anything I write, and when you come as must sometimes, on bits that look like bits of yourself spoiled, --to think that I have been mean enough to borrow from you knowingly, &amp; without acknowledgment. How much your general influence has told upon me, I know not—but I always confess it—or rather boast of it, in conversation about you and you will see what—considering the way malicious people <span style="font-style:italic">catch</span> at such confessions, is certainly a very frank one—at the close of the lecture of which I send you a Builder containing a report<span id="ftn9_return"><a class="notelink" title="A report of Ruskin’s lectures on “Decorative Colour.” For this and the “passage,” see Works, XII, 507 and n." href="#ftn9"><sup>9</sup></a></span>.

      <p class="Normal" style="text-align:left; ">Dear Ruskin,</p>
      <p class="Normal" style="text-align:left; ">It has been a thousand times a sorrow in my thought that I have not seen you all this time; and the worse as I partly had to give myself the blame of it. I got your sumptuous and excellent gift (Stones of Venice II and III to add to Vol. I); and never had the grace to utter one word of acknowledgement (I do suspect and believe) manifold thoughts and emotions to that effect as I necessarily had! Sinner that I am, --heavy-laden bewildered sinner; not willing one, no; --whom, in your goodness, and candor of merciful judgement, you cannot forgive! —</p>
      <p class="Normal" style="text-align:left; ">The truth is, I have been eclipsed into nearly utter darkness this long while, by Prussian dust<span id="ftn11_return"><a class="notelink" title="Carlyle had been working hard since 1852 on his History of Frederick the Great.

      <p class="Normal" style="text-align:left; ">If you will really come and see me any evening or day (especially after half-past 3, --or otherwise giving warning before), it will be a chosen mercy to me, I can answer you. The view of a sincere human soul, even without<span style="font-style:italic"> thought</span> in it, is like music to me; how much more if there is an opulence of human thoughts and cheery ingenuities and socialities in it!</p>
      <p class="Normal" style="text-align:left; ">We have tea every ev<sup>g </sup>(hardly ever out) about half past 7.

      <p class="Normal" style="text-align:left; ">I am very sorry to hear of your coughing and continued sickliness. Be patient, quiet; --this is a monition to you to take more time! My impression generally is that you go too fast; in many senses, this; --and that you will have to learn the other side of the business too, --what infinite profit there occasionally is in sitting absolutely down (were it even in a desperate mood, on hest of inexorable necessity), and <span style="font-style:italic">doing nothing</span>. This is very true; and I hope you will learn to believe it: --at all events, act upon it at present, on trust; and be <span style="font-style:italic">loyal</span> to the idle Summer Air, till that has set you on your feet again.</p>
      <p class="Normal" style="text-align:left; ">Some afternoon, were you once home, you must come out hither, and take me to your place; I will wander about with you till night; and not fail to make my way <span style="font-style:italic">back</span> on my own resources. That, I suppose, might answer? To myself it would be a pleasant half-holiday; a pause in the sandy wilderness on reaching some convenient stopping-place. Keep it in your eye.</p>
      <p class="Normal" style="text-align:left; ">My Prussian affairs are as bad almost as <span style="font-style:italic">Balaklava</span>,<span id="ftn14_return"><a class="notelink" title="Scene of the infamous “Charge of the Light Brigade,” which took place on October 25, 1854, during the Crimean War." href="#ftn14"><sup>14</sup></a></span> and indeed resemble that notable Enterprise of the Turk War in several respects, --in an adventure, with such associates; and that<span style="font-style:italic"> good</span> result to it does not seem (for most part) so much as possible! “The longer you look at it,” as Sir John Burgoyne<span id="ftn15_return"><a class="notelink" title="Sir John Fox Burgoyne (1782-1871). The quotation has not been identified.

They too are willing to <span style="font-style:italic">die</span> mutely in the mud, and so expiate their Noodlism in some small degree. A thing worth being laid to heart, by certain others of us! —</p>

Also, I have prepared about thirty drawings for engravers this year, retouched the engravings (generally the worst part of the business), and etched some on steel myself. In the course of the six hundred pages have had various remarks on German Metaphysics, on Poetry, Political Economy, Cookery, Music, Geology, Dress, Agriculture, Horticulture, and Navigation, all of which subjects I have had to “read up” accordingly, and this takes time. Moreover, I have had my class of workmen out sketching every week in the fields during the summer;<span id="ftn20_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ruskin taught a landscape-drawing class at the Working Men’s college from October 1854 to May 1858.

I have also designed and drawn a window for the Museum at Oxford; and have every now and then had to look over a parcel of five or six new designs for fronts and backs to the said Museum.</p>
      <p class="Normal" style="text-align:left; ">During my above-mentioned studies of horticulture, I became dissatisfied with the Linnaean, Jussieuan, and Everybody-elseian arrangement of plants, and have accordingly arranged a system of my own; and unbound my botanical book, and rebound it in brighter green, with all the pages through-other, and backside foremost—so as to cut off all the old paging numerals; and am now printing my new arrangement in a legible manner, on interleaved foolscap. I consider this arrangement one of my great achievements of the year. My studies of political economy have induced me to think also that nobody knows anything about that; and I am at present engaged in an investigation, on independent principles, of the natures of money, rent, and taxes, in an abstract form, which sometimes keeps awake all night. My studies of German metaphysics have also induced me to think that the Germans don’t know anything about <span style="font-style:italic">them</span>; and to engage in a serious enquiry into the meaning of Bunsen’s great sentence in the beginning of the second volume of the “Hippolytus,” about the Finite realization of infinity;<span id="ftn22_return"><a class="notelink" title="Christian, Freiherr Bunsen (1791-1860).

I have little pleasure –and no pain –except toothache sometimes. I forget, resovedly, all that human beings are doing of ridiculous, or suffering of its consequences; try to regret nothing –and to wish for nothing. I am obliged to pass much time in mere quiet –and standing with one’s hand behind one’s back is tiresome –I make up my mind to be tired and stand. The nights –if one wakes in them, are sadly long –one tries to think “after all –it is life –why should one wish it shorter” –and one is thankful, in spite of such philosophy, when the clock strikes— (I wonder if one would be –or wild be –when it is a passing bell that strikes –which will be the same thing, once for all.) When I’ve read Xenophon’s economist[</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:222222">sic</span><span style="color:222222">], and Plato’s republic and one or two more things carefully, I shall finish –if I can –my political economy –of other plans, or hopes, I have none for the present. These is enough, and a great deal too much of myself. Mr. Carlyle will be angry with me for not going on with German, but it is impossible among Germans; the people make me – (or </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:222222">would</span><span style="color:222222"> make me if I contemplated them) too angry to endure their language. Switzerland is degenerating –at least its people are –(and the lakes are not so clear as they used to be) – The Peasantry seem still nearly what they were –(that is to say, little more than two-legged cattle). The townspeople imitate and hate the French, having neither dignity enough to stand on their own ground, nor beauty or modesty enough to respect these they borrow from. By rifle practice, and much drinking, and making disgusting noises in the street at night, they are preparing themselves against French invasion. But what of silent and worthy is yet among them I do not see, and have no business to abuse them in general terms. </span></p>

Edwardes 9now a major) was in England in 1850-51, and in the winter of 1850 had published them under the title <span style="font-style:italic">A Knight’s Faith</span> as part IV of <span style="font-style:italic">Bibliotheca Pastorum </span>(1885).

It was a place of abomination where fires were continually kept burning to destroy the city’s refuse, and it thus became a synonym for Hell in the New Testament. Carlyle’s handwriting here makes my use of the word “murk” disputable. Collingwood (I,175) has “mask”, which may be right: and Peter Quennell, <span style="font-style:italic">John Ruskin: The Portrait of a Prophet </span>(1949, p.74), has “marsh,” which seems incongruous.

               <p class="Footnote Text">Carlyle had been working hard since 1852 on his <span style="font-style:italic">History of Frederick the Great</span>.</p>
               <p class="Footnote Text"><span class="Footnote_Characters"> </span>Carlyle underlines the word “<span style="font-style:italic">citra</span>” twice, and the phrase is thus roughly translated as “shoemaker <span style="font-style:italic">without</span> shoe.” It is a play upon a familiar Latin proverb—“Ne sutor supra crepidam”—that nineteenth-century schoolboys found in Pliny the Elder’s <span style="font-style:italic">Natural History</span> and translated as “let the cobbler stick to his last.” Its more literal translation, with the addition of Pliny’s verb <span style="font-style:italic">judicaret</span>, means “let the shoemaker not judge beyond shoes,” and Carlyle’s phrasing thus describes a cobbler who could not even judge shoes, or never made a good shoe to “stick to.” When Ruskin published his <span style="font-style:italic">Unto This Last</span> in 1860, an anonymous critic in <span style="font-style:italic">Fraser’s Magazine</span> (November 1860, p.659) suggested changing the title to “Beyond the Last.””We never knew a more signal violation of the good old rule, ‘<span style="font-style:italic">Ne sutor ultra crepidam</span>,’” he grumbled.</p>

               <p class="Footnote Text">Unidentified. Sanders (p. 211) believes this may be Henry T. Wake, an engraver whom both Carlyle and Ruskin knew. He adds, however, that he has found “no hint of his being a Quaker or of any difficulty which would have caused Carlyle to call him a Grampus (fish of the dolphin family).” The<span style="font-style:italic"> Oxford English Dictionary</span> lists another meaning for “Grampus” which was in use by 1836— “a person who breathes loud.” Wake may thus have “spouted off” and got into trouble somehow.</p>

               <p class="Footnote Text">On March 4, 1856, a debate was held in Parliament on a motion, introduced by Philip Henry Stanhope (the fifth Earl Stanhope) to create a British National Portrait Gallery. The motion was passed, and somewhere during the proceedings Stanhope delivered the quotation from Lord Nelson that Carlyle refers to in this letter. Carlyle’s letter to Lady Ashburton in this same month tells us more of the incident: “Ruskin is in a great passion with Lord Stanhope and the poor House of Lords for that Reading of Nelson’s last speech: ‘A coronet or Westminster Abbey’ said his poor Lordship, instead of ‘Victory or West<sup>r</sup> Abbey,’ nobody correcting him; which sets the high moral small-beer of Ruskin all into a froth. Instead of ‘this piece of work done, or else my life!’ to make it ‘that peacock’s feather got, or death in seeking it!’ What a platitude and turpitude, thinks Ruskin and decides to ‘pitch into it’ (as he says) asking me first to do so; who refuse utterly, tho’ in a benevolent manner. <span style="font-style:italic">Ach Gott, ach Gott</span>!” (MS: Northampton.)</p>

The occasion for the remark was the dinner the Nelson gave for his officers, his “band of brothers,” just before entering Aboukir Bay in the late afternoon of August 1, 1798, where he would completely annihilate the French Mediterranean battle fleet in what later came to be called the Battle of the Nile. Nelson’s expectations were quite correct. Having survived the engagement with but a superficial wound to the head, he was created Baron Nelson of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe by letters patent as soon as news of the victory reached England.</p>

He had first visited the school in the previous March, having apparently been invited to do so by Miss Margaret Alexis Bell, the headmistress. Ruskin enjoyed his visit there so much that he paid many calls there in future years, and the school became important to him. Two of his works –<span style="font-style:italic">The Elements of Perspective</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Ethos of the Dust</span> –grew directly from his experiences there.

The smith then said “there was a strange feeling of cold iron in his inwards. ‘shake thyself,’ said Mimer; the luckless Wight did so, and fell in two halves.” (Carlyle’s <span style="font-style:italic">Works,</span> XXVII, 223.)</p>
