    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">Dear Ruskin, </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">    That was an excellent scheme you had of writing to me daily a detached nit of thought, observation, or experience,—excellent, had you but been able to continue.  The three or four you sent came duly, each of them a blazing fire’s flake, or direct photograph of the minute passing over Rome and you; altogether strengthening and pleasant to the mind of the recipient.  But, alas, it could not continue; with that wildly touching, and as if tragic disinterment of the poor old Christian Church of “the third century” into the closing epoch of Pio Nono and company, your fire flakes or quasi-living photographs suddenly ceased, and I have remained ever since, not from that cause alone though doubtless that helped, one of the most indolent, torpid and useless souls now extant on this Planet.  In sad truth, except walking every morning to the end of our embankment  and back on the finest sleekest most undisturbed and soothing promenade I ever had, </span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic"> nothing </span><span style="font-size:12pt">has been done by me but another rather longer walk or crawl, latish in the afternoon, into one or other of the Parks, and idle reading or slumber and sleep all day and all night.  I say to myself, but not too angrily, is this what they call </span> <span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic">eu</span><span style="font-size:12pt">thanasia? </span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic">eu</span><span style="font-size:12pt">thanasia? Well, well! In fact there is no end to the cloudy musings I have,—especially on that benignant Chelsea embankment; unluckily until Death itself come there is no escaping the dismal necessity to eat food and the still more dismal and almost impossible ditto to digest the same. Patience, patience; Hope, too little; and thanks always and loyal reverence to the Almighty Builder. Amen.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">About a week ago, I got from Aylesbury,</span><span id="ftn1_return"><a class="notelink" title="Letter 40. MS: Bembridge. Hitherto unpbd.The Aylesbury works of Messrs. Hazell, Watson and Viney, where Ruskin’s later books were printed." href="#ftn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span style="font-size:12pt"> the promised first proof sheet of your Book on Botany, which to judge from this first sample, will be a most welcome Book to me, such as I have never met with before in my struggles, completely fruitless hitherto, to get any insight into the “Science of Botany” or those strange and beautiful fellow creatures of ours that make lovely every year the face of this “rugged all-supporting Earth.”  What a long-eared people that Guild of scientific gentlemen is and has been here below!—</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">Your Architect Gold Medal, left stranded on the waste beach, had an immense rumour for some days in London; and I doubt not is still standing like a fateful Sphinx-riddle in the minutes of many men. The blame I think was not laid heavily on you, but the astonishment, the mocking pity for the Medal and its authors was large and loud. I continue to discern that in your situation and in that of Architecture there could nothing else be done. I have heard a great deal also about your volunteer young gentlemen, delvers &amp; diggers, now busy about Oxford; really an most miraculous thing; proof such as was not seen for long ages of the influence of an earnest man upon earnest youths; at which even the penny-a-liner pauses for a moment, uncertain what to say or do. In fact it becomes clearer to the world than ever that there is but one Ruskin in the world; an unguidable man, but with quantities of lightning in the interior of him, which are strange and probably dangerous to behold. Well, well; unguidable to outsiders you surely are; and you justly may pretend to spend your own lightning in the way you find suitablest to this wildly anarchic condition of affairs. Continue only for a quarter of a century yet as you may fairly hope to do; there will be something of result visible, something of combustion, kindling here and there in the dark, boundless belly of our Chaos; and meanwhile the clang of the silver bow will be cheering to all the select of men.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">I wish you would write to me at once again, and say clearly what your address is, and is to be in the now-current weeks: what your describable employments are and when we may look for you home. Adieu, dear Ruskin; you know well enough what my thoughts towards you are. With my whole soul I wish you noble victory and success.</span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">I come down here to write, every morning now. The Sacristan makes me a cup of coffee, and then leaves me quiet for three hours, from 7 to 10,—and I get much done. The room is precisely that of a Highland cottage but too windowed,—whitewashed walls—the windows in deep recesses, three feet high by two wide, looking out on—not Scottish, but nevertheless, true Highlands—a deep valley set with olives, running up into limestone hills covered with pasture and forest, 2 to 3000 feet—then above,—rising in rocky and arid slopes of Apennine.</span></p>

And his heart is in it.—Also—he agrees wholly with Papa and me, that there never was on earth yet such a horrible age as this, for corruption and madness.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">“Remember,” he says, “what Fra Antonio tells you—I may die or live to see it, but, before this age is over, (questo secolo) [“this century or age”] there will be such a plague, or war as has not been yet in the world,—and few men left, from the chastisement of God.”—And truly—things are too horrible to last long now. I am tired with many thoughts about what I have to do, and my own feebleness or worthlessness.</span></p>

Go on at any rate, so long as it is not a bother to you, and know always that nothing you can do is more certain of a grateful welcome.  I think we have had eight Letters since I wrote to you last, and now that you are going  or gone to Perugia and we are soon to be driven out of London by the fervent heat, I write again to apprize you as far as possible when we are going whitherward, both of which points, especially the latter, are still somewhat involved in haze.</span></p>

Froude, Esq., Crogan.

    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">Dearest Papa,</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">    I was out among the vines and maize last night, across the Serchio—now only a mountain stream, running among long banks of shingle, and </span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic">almost</span> <span style="font-size:12pt">clear;—but with no voice, like Tweed or Liddel.  I shut my eyes and listened, to find if by any imagination—or honest defiance of imagination—I could fancy myself listening to Tweed at Melrose.  But no—utterly shallow and empty—the Italian stream in voice, as an Italian opera song to the fullest of Burns, in thought.  The reasons were clear enough, on looking.  The shingle was as wide as Tweed’s, but was of dull limestone instead of ringing quartz—and for twenty </span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic">round</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> pebbles, lay one square stone.  The water flowed past, silently instead of tinkling </span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic">through</span><span style="font-size:12pt">.—In the second place,—there were no deepcut channels through enduring rock, to give gush, and hollow tone—the bass to the pebble-trebble. Nothing but waste of stones and sand—the signs of the folly and misery which left the river to overflow the plain in winter.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">I went on, through winding lanes between maize and vine—sunset turning into little nimbuses the bunches of white filaments at the ends of the ears of maize—the peasants at work, of old Etruscan feature, bidding me good evening rightly and quietly. At last at the turn of a path, I met a pretty dark-edged boy of eleven or twelve years old. He knelt down in front of me quickly, silently, like a dog ordered to do so, on both knees—holding out his cap. There was no servility in the action anymore than would be in the dog’s—great beauty in it—and in the entirely quiet face, not beseeching, but submitting its cause to you. I never saw such a thing before. The real root of it is in Etruscan religion, and the Ghibelline training of the old town, in Castruccio’s time, &amp; before.</span><span id="ftn45_return"><a class="notelink" title="Castruccio Castracani degli Antelminelli (1281-1328), Ghibelline leader and ruler of Lucca from 1316 until his death.

He entrusted Froude with the decision of whether many of these papers should eventually be published as a memorial record of his wife’s life, but by 1874 Froude had not yet made his decision. On July 10, 1874, six weeks before leaving South Africa, Froude wrote a touching letter to Carlyle concerning these papers. “I should like to hear something of your plans that I may see you again before I go,” he said. “You must give me directions about the sacred letters and Papers which you have trusted to my charge.—whether you wish them to be returned to your custody during my absence—or whether they shall be locked up in a sealed parcel in Onslow Gardens with instructions, in case I never come back, to be placed in such hands as you will desire. If God so orders it, I will fulfil the trust which you have committed to me with such powers as I have.—No greater evidence of confidence was ever given by one man of mine will ever convey the obligations which I feel…I hope we may both live till I can relate my experiences to you, and witness, I trust, some effect produced which you will recognize as good. The thought of you will still be with me wherever I go to encourage, guide and govern me.” (MS: Folger Shakespeare Library.) </p>

Rosa was an academically trained court painter who proclaimed his specialty to be portraiture and historical views; the nineteenth century chiefly admired his vivid, tempestuous landscapes, which he himself considered to be his lesser work. His own vigorous and rebellious life and the atmosphere of his landscapes won for him the reputation of a precursor of the Romantic age among Ruskin’s contemporaries; but his draughtsmanship was, in essence, as classically severe as that of his contemporaries, Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. Ruskin’s reference to landscape here reflects the record prices Rosa’s paintings in that genre were fetching in the 1870’s.</p>
