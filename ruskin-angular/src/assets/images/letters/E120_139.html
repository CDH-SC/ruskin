Many thanks to you for so pleasant and instructive a gift.  The work is full of beautiful and delicate perceptions, new ideas, both new and true, which throw a bright illumination  over that important piece of History, and awake fresh curiosities and speculations on that and on other much wider subjects.

Your visit to me still hangs in the vague; your very pen to me-wards continues uncomfortably stingy; but we will hope, we will hope.  I am not very well; but it is mainly Old Age that ails me, so that there is nothing to be said, or complained of.

English companies, over-buying each other ten times succeed as proprietors of the share, and all along the bay is one wilderness of beaten down houses and dustheaps to be sold in lots.

          <p class="footnote text">Ruskin had for years been incensed over the destruction of valuable buildings and works of art in the name of “progress” and “restoration,” and he blamed all those who had anything to do with the situation, either actively or passively. Thus he refused the Gold Medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects, which had been offered to him in March 1874. His letter to the institute can be found in <span style="font-style:italic">Works</span>, XXXIV, 513-14.</p>
          <p class="footnote text">Ruskin’s remarks about “Gothic” and “Greek” refer to the famous “Battle of the Styles” in which English architects championed both Neo-Gothic and Neo-Renaissance styles during the late 1850s and 1860s. Gilbert Scott, one of Ruskin’s friends and president of the Royal Institute of Architects in 1874, was once forced by Lord Palmerston to change his Gothic design for the India Office (opposite Whitehall) to Italian Classical—an act that did not endear Palmerston to Ruskin.

          <p class="footnote text">This church is one of the most ancient in Rome, dating from the sixth century, with its foundation resting on the remains of the temple of Hercules. The public grain-distribution center that replaced the temple under Theodosius the Great was later transformed into a church for the use of the Greek community in Rome and was for centuries called Santa Maria in Schola Graeca. By the tenth century it had become the seat of a cardinal-deacon, and when, in 1064, it was largely destroyed by the forces of Robert Guiscard, its titulars began the long rebuilding program that gave the building its present appearance. Much of the medieval architecture was invisible during Ruskin’s time because of extensive restoration carried out in the early eighteenth century by Cardinal Annibale Albani, but this was removed in 1899, exposing the old construction.</p>
          <p class="footnote text">The sermon Ruskin describes was that of the octave of the Ascension, delivered by the vicar capitular or his deputy, as the church had no cardinal assigned to it from 1858 to 1875.</p>

          <p class="footnote text">The church of Santissima Trinità de’ Monti, the French parish in Rome, was erected under the patronage of Charles VIII of France in 1495 in reparation for his occupation of Rome. In 1587 it became the title church of a cardinal-priest. Having been devasted by riots during the French Revolution, it was restored in 1816 at the expense of Louis XVIII.</p>

          <p class="footnote text">Ruskin’s subsequent description makes it almost unquestionable that he is referring to the little basilica of Santa Petronilla built in the center of the upper level of the Catacombs of Domitilla, one of the most ancient Christian burial grounds in Rome. The structure, originally constructed to contain the body of the saint venerated as Saint Peter’s principal Roman disciple, had a nave and aisles on an approximately square ground plan. It was in use as a place of public worship from the fifth to the eighth century, when the body of the saint was translated to the Vatican and the old site forgotten. It was rediscovered in 1874 and was fully excavated the following year. For additional details see G.B. De Rossi, “Sepolocro di S. Petronilla nella basilica in via Ardeatina e sua translazione al Vaticano,” in <span style="font-style:italic">Bulletino di archeologia cristiana</span>, 1878, pp.125-46, and 1879, pp. 5-20; and August Urbain, <span style="font-style:italic">Ein Martyrologium der christliche Gemeinde zu Rom</span> (Leipzig, 1901), p.152.</p>

          <p class="footnote text">A reference to the famous Vespers service of the French nuns of the convent of the Dames du Sacré-Coeur, attached to the church of Santissima Trinità de’ Monti (See Letter 138). Mendelssohn was so impressed by the performance of these “singing nuns” that he dedicated his three motets, opus 39, to them after hearing them in 1830. See Lady (Grace) Wallace, <span style="font-style:italic">Letters from Italy and Switzerland</span> (1862), pp.85-86, letter of December 30, 1830.</p>
