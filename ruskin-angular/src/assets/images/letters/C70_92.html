    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">Dear Mr. Carlyle, </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">I have had a heavy time of it since I wrote last, in various ways of which I cannot tell you; not that there is anything in my mind which I would not trust you to know, but because there are some conditions of trouble for which one has no business to ask sympathy even from one’s dearest friends.</span><span id="ftn1_return"><a class="notelink" title="Letter 70.

    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">(4</span><sup style="font-size:12pt">th</sup><span style="font-size:12pt"> April) And now I do not know if it is of the least use to send this to Mentone; but I will let it take its chance—the main thing that I wanted to say to you being that I have had to meditate somewhat closely over educational questions lately, and I am more than ever impressed with the sense of the greatness of the gift you could bestow in the good close of all your labour by a summary of your present vision of history, and of its causative forces: not writing the history of any country, but marking  the conclusions to which you had come in reading its history yourself; and telling us the events that were of essential significance; &amp; separating them in their true relations, from things useless.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">Suppose I were to ask you, for instance, briefly (not being able to read for myself any history of Spain)—what had made the Spaniard of today what he is? You would sit down in your fender-corner, and roll me out an entirely clear and round statement of the main dealings of Providence and of the Devil with him—and of him with them. Now if you were to write down such an answer—of its quarter of an hour’s length—and then amplify &amp; illustrate it as you saw good, it would be a perfect guide to me, for such labour as I could undertake on the subject—but which without a guide would be wholly thrown away—so that indeed I should never undertake it.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">Do think of this, in your rambles under the olive trees. I hope, wherever you are, that this weather has found you still in Italy, and that you will outstay the Firefly time. I always think that nothing in the world can possibly be so touching, in its own natural sweetness, and in the association with the pensive and glorious power of the scene, as the space of spring time in Italy during which the firefly makes the meadows quiver at twilight. And then if you were to get up to the lakes, in May! and go back up the Val Formazza over the Gries and Grimsel, and so to the Giesback Inn on the lake of Brientz, you would find that in early June the happiest—coolest—warmest—cosiest—wildest work! and two dear good Swiss girls would wait on you, who would remember my two little girls</span><span id="ftn2_return"><a class="notelink" title="Joan Agnew, Ruskin’s cousin, and Constance Hilliard, niece of Lady Trevelyan, both of whom had accompanied Ruskin and the Trevelyans during their Cont…" href="#ftn2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span style="font-size:12pt"> and me, last year—and do everything they could—&amp; they could a great deal –to make you comfortable.—And now I must say good-bye—and please forgive this nothing of a letter.  I might have told you a great deal, that only would have vexed you,—nothing—is better.</span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">Dear Ruskin, </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">  With a Poet’s temperament, you immensely exaggerate this miserable, but intrinsically small and paltry matter.  “The most dishonouring words ever spoken of you” are, as you will understand by and by, simply to the effect, that you in yr headlong incautious way, with the best and truest intentions in the world, strode into one of the foolishest practical puddles recently heard of and dragged a most unwitting friend along with you, —who refuses to lie there with you (especially to lie </span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic">undermost</span><span style="font-size:12pt">, as he chanced to be), and, finding you took no steps and did not even recognize the puddle much has striven honestly to save first himself and then his more or less blameable compan</span><sup style="font-size:12pt">n</sup><span style="font-size:12pt"> too,—really with his best endeavour, and utmost stretch of faculty and skill, exerted in an element infinitely foreign and unpleas</span><sup style="font-size:12pt">t</sup> <span style="font-size:12pt">to him.

    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">First, therefore, I never told you, nor c</span><sup style="font-size:12pt">d</sup><span style="font-size:12pt"> tell or have told any mortal, that “Mr. Carlyle” was liable to be insulted on the streets of London or Chelsea; the constant </span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic">fact</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> being that I have the natural liberty of all quiet persons to walk the streets unmolested, and if need were, protected &amp; defended; and that in no street, lane or place of London or ay other City, Town  or region, did “Mr. Carlyle,” when personally recognized, meet with anything hitherto but an evid</span><sup style="font-size:12pt">t</sup> <span style="font-size:12pt">respect far beyond what was his due, or what was in the least necessary to him.  This is the steadfast fact; and this you have carelessly tumbled heels over head into a statement incredible to all who hear it, and monstrous to imagine.

This I perfectly remember telling you. And what mad reversal you have made of this you cannot have forgotten! A domestic picture unexampled in British History or biography.

    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">In fine, so far as I can recollect those unlucky 10 minutes of loose talk, wh</span><sup style="font-size:12pt">h</sup><span style="font-size:12pt"> memory took so little charge of, and wh</span><sup style="font-size:12pt">h</sup><span style="font-size:12pt"> are now several weeks away, our discourse did not turn upon public streets, thorough-fares or</span> <span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic">walking</span><span style="font-size:12pt">, but almost wholly on my experiences in </span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic">riding</span><span style="font-size:12pt">, thro' the unfrequented slums and waste-lying outskirts of London (tempted thither by the soft ground, or the immunity from wheels), where the lower populace or canaille inhabit: nor, ag</span><sup style="font-size:12pt">n</sup><span style="font-size:12pt">, was my experience there the least definiable as “Mr. Carlyle’s,” but simply as that of A. or B., riding, seemingly for his amusem</span> <sup style="font-size:12pt">t</sup><span style="font-size:12pt">, and from his age or gravity of aspect, not very likely to use his horsewhip in reply (wh</span><sup style="font-size:12pt">h</sup> <span style="font-size:12pt">more than once proved a miscalculat</span><sup style="font-size:12pt">n</sup><span style="font-size:12pt">, too, and had firm effect on the individual  two-legged </span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-style:italic">canis</span><span style="font-size:12pt">, if he chanced  to stand within reach).

          <p class="footnote text">Cook, II, 114, quotes Ruskin on his condition at this time: “In 1867 the first warning mischief to my health showed itself, giddiness and mistiness of head and eyes, which stopped alike my drawing and thinking to any good purpose.” Ruskin’s diary entries for this period confirm his remarks, and one must also remember that at this time he was feverishly counting the days until the 21<sup>st</sup> birthday of Rose La Touche, when he was to receive an answer to his proposal of marriage made in Feburary 1866. J.L. Bradley, in his edition of <span style="font-style:italic">The Letters of John Ruskin to Lord and Lady Mount-Temple </span>(Columbus, Ohio, 1964), pp.111 and 113, notes that Ruskin had received hostile letters from Rose’s parents in February and March, and had been thus put in a state of “black anger”.</p>

          <p class="footnote text">Ruskin was then publishing in his <span style="font-style:italic">Time and Tide</span>, written in the form of letters to “a Working Man of Sunderland,” in the Manchester newspapers. In one of the letters he reported a conversation in which Carlyle had said that he could not walk in the streets of Chelsea “without being insulted, chiefly because he is a grey, old man; and also because he is cleanly dressed…” This paragraph was printed in many newspapers, and drew shocked inquiries from several working men to Carlyle. On May 22, Carlyle wrote a public letter to “a working man at Rochdale,” in which he said that “the thing now ‘going the rounds’ is untrue, diverges from the fact throughout, and [is]… ‘incredible’” On May 28, he wrote the following letter “to The Editor of the Pall Mall Gazette”: “In reference to a Newspaper Paragraph now idly circulating, with my name in it as connected with ‘insults on the streets’ and other such matter,—permit me to say that it is an untrue Paragraph, disagrees with the fact throughout, and in essentials is curiously the reverse of the fact; a Paragraph altogether erroneous, misfounded, and even absurd.” (MS: Dr. Frederick. W. Hilles.) The letter was printed in the <span style="font-style:italic">Gazette </span>on May 29, and Ruskin’s diary for that date records a “foolish letter of C in papers” (<span style="font-style:italic">Diaries</span>, II, 619). The above letter is Ruskin’s answer to it, starting a brief but bitter quarrel, which runs through the next few letters in their correspondence. See also the Introduction.</p>

That I by no means join in heavily blaming Mr. Ruskin, and, indeed, do not blame him at all, but the contrary, except for the almost inconceivable practical blunder of printing my name, and then of carelessly hurling topsy-turvy into wild incredibility all he had to report to me—of me, and indirectly of the whole vast multitude of harmless neighbors, whom I live with here—in London and its suburbs, more than 2,000,000 of us, I should think, who all behave by second nature in an obliging, peaceable, and perfectly human manner to each other, and are all struck with amazement at Mr. Ruskin’s hasty paragraph upon us.</p>
          <p class="footnote text">2<sup>nd</sup>. That in regard to the populace or <span style="font-style:italic">canaille</span> of London , to the class distinguishable by behaviour as our non-human, or half-human neighbors, which class is considerably more extensive and miscellaneous, and much more dismal and disgusting than you seem to think, I substantially agree with all that Mr. Ruskin has said of it.</p>
          <p class="footnote text" style="text-align:right;">I remain, Sir, </p>
          <p class="footnote text" style="text-align:right;">Your obedient servant, </p>
          <p class="footnote text" style="text-align:right;">T.Carlyle</p>
          <p class="footnote text">See R.H. Shepherd, <span style="font-style:italic">Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Thomas Carlyle </span> (1881) II, 251-52. Excerpts are also given in Cook, II, 117. The MS of Carlyle’s first draft of this letter is in the possession of Bembridge School, and is dated June 7, 1869, by Carlyle. Under this date Carlyle has written two notes. The first seems to be addressed to J.A. Froude at a later date and declares:” From <span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin</span> of 1 June in adjacent (I think there was one before, but I have by mistake destroyed it;—it essentially said (with …[word illegible] provocat<sup>n</sup>) ‘Tell me what you did say then?’—Impossible!” The second note says “No.4 (Letter to ‘Times,’ in consequence of No.3). Today (8 june) have sent a <span style="font-style:italic">Note to Ruskin </span>(rigorous but good-humoured—as absolute <span style="font-style:italic">Finis</span> to the paltriest absurdity I was ever dragged into as if in my sleep!)”</p>

          <p class="footnote text">Carlyle probably refers to this visit in a letter to Froude on September 14, 1869: “One day, by express desire on both sides, I had Ruskin for some hours. Really interesting and entertaining, a much improved Ruskin since he went in May last. He is full of projects, of generous prospective activities, some of which, I opined to him, would prove chimerical. There is (in singular environment) a ray of real Heaven in poor Ruskin;—passages of that last book (Queen of Air) went into my heart like arrows.” (Cook, 11, 164-65; also in Froude, IV, 383.) A letter written the next day to Lady Ashburton (MS: Marquess of Northampton) repeats this opinion, claiming Ruskin “much improved by his N. of Italy sojourn.”</p>
