    <br>
    <p>
        In nineteenth-century Great Britain, John Ruskin (1819-1900) was a figure about whom no reader could have been ignorant: 
        a public intellectual, in our terms, who had ideas about what buildings should 
        look like, what Christianity should be, what paintings were valuable and not, 
        what responsibility the state had to its citizens and 
        what responsibilities citizens had to the state. He wrote about myths and about science, 
        about the duties of the sexes, the limits of capitalism, the pleasures of dancing, the meaning 
        of the Alps, the sorrowful testimony of Venice. He tried to transform the heart of Great Britain. 
        And he also sold tea. The private thoughts and ideas of this huge figure of nineteenth-century 
        Great Britain are also available. Ruskin kept a diary journal through most of his working life. 
        And it has never been published in full in any open access, color, and high quality form.
