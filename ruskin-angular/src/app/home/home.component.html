    <p>In nineteenth-century Great Britain, John Ruskin (1819-1900) was a figure about whom no reader could have been ignorant: 
      a public intellectual, in ourterms, who had ideas about what buildings should look like, what Christianity should be, what 
      paintings were valuable and not, what responsibility the state had to its citizens and what responsibilities citizens had to 
      the state. He wrote about myths and about science, about the duties of the sexes, the limits of capitalism, the pleasures of 
      dancing, the meaning of the Alps, the sorrowful testimony of Venice. He tried to transform the heart of Great Britain. And he 
      also sold tea The private thoughts and ideas of this huge figure of nineteenth-century Great Britain are also available. Ruskin 
      kept a diary journal through most of his working life. And it has never been published in full in any open access, color, and high quality form.
      Ruskin’s diary journals–distributed in archives across the UK and US–are copious, searching, luminous, and bothered. They reveal the observations 
      and the development of ideas that would, often enough, make the public world of print. They are a kind of personal workshop for the public man. But 
      they are also private: reflections on states of mind, on states of soul, on a personal perception of the condition of Europe. Charting the energies of a 
      great writer, the journals also open up the tormented world of Ruskin’s heart and the periodic failing of his mental health. They are impossible to summarize and 
      replete with the testimonies of a life lived both to the full and, increasingly, on the verge.</p>
