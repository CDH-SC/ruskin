  <p> </p>
  <p>Henry has read to me the scene at </p>
  <p><span class="unclear">Sundown[?]</span> between Herod &amp; Salome
  </p>
  <p>– the waiting for Mariamne’s death. </p>
  <p>– It is level up with <span style="text-decoration:underline">Othello</span>.</p>
  <p>It has made March already a
  </p>
  <p>month of huge experience</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>And there is verdure &amp; quickening

  <p>green all <span class="unclear">round[?]</span> the smaller</p>
  <p>scenes. More &amp; more the </p>
  <p>story is <span class="unclear">tightening[?]</span> to the throttling
  </p>
  <p>love-grip of Mariamne. Herod’s </p>
  <p>passion in its curse, its cheeks,
  </p>
  <p>its headlong fall into the sea – </p>
  <p>the theme. He asked the </p>
  <p>Infinite in his affections, the </p>
  <p>infinite of Woman, Child, &amp; </p>
  <p>God. He was infinite in praise </p>
  <p>and in the art of praise-</p>
  <p>building. His memory built
  </p>
  <p>in monuments.</p>
  <p>The vacant memory of regret he </p>
  <p>could not bear, – that is why he </p>
  <p>carried Mariamne about with </p>
  <p>his <span class="unclear">embalmment[?]</span>.</p>
  <p>In Herod I create myself Man – </p>
  <p>– the make of Herod’s nature is </p>
  <p>mine.</p>
  <p>How wonderful Heaven is to us – </p>
  <p>– setting us on the track, giving us </p>
  <p>the clue to its hid treasure –</p>

  <p>Then Fay comes, hurried, looking </p>
  <p>very small, meeting Shannon </p>
  <p>with amity, &amp; the Curl with

  <p>the assurance it makes its </p>

  <p>Fay has been talking to an </p>

  <p>has pleased him by realising that </p>

  <p>will dedicate Shakspere, Pedagogue </p>
  <p>&amp; Poacher to us.</p>
  <p>Then Fay reads Verlaine’s
  </p>
  <p>marvelous Langeur (“Jadis </p>
  <p>et Naguère”)</p>
  <p>I shall always hear his voice, </p>
  <p>low as an underground </p>
  <p>rillet – now &amp; then with </p>
  <p>petulant emphasis – as it </p>
  <p>gave:</p>
  <p>“O n'y vouloir, o n'y pouvoir mourir </p>
  <p>un peu!
  </p>
  <p>Ah, Tout est bu, toute est mangé – plus </p>
  <p>rien à dire.”</p>
  <p>And again:
  </p>
  <p>“L'Ame seulette a mal au coeur d'un </p>
  <p>ennui dense”</p>
  <p>And the massive first line </p>
  <p>becomes of fate, yet altogether </p>
  <p>personal, in his convinced </p>
  <p>voice – </p>
  <p>“Je suis l'Empire à la fin de la décadence.”</p>
  <p>Fay says this poem is that rarest </p>
  <p>thing, that had only been known </p>
  <p>in English &amp; Italian, a <span style="text-decoration:underline">Dramatic</span></p>
  <p>Sonnet, as Browning wrote <span style="text-decoration:underline">Dramatic</span></p>
  <p>Lyrics. Michael grieves Browning </p>
  <p>never found the Dramatic Sonnet. </p>
  <p>Rossetti has several examples. Fay </p>
  <p>hates specially the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">exquite</span> exquisite repetitions</p>
  <p>– A special charm in Verlaine – &amp; the even </p>

  <p>“<span class="unclear">trying[?]</span>” – We will see what mooding</p>
  <p>does. No fighting with Satan – no more </p>
  <p>giving the least heed <span class="unclear">to
            him[?]</span>.</p>
  <p>– More prayer &amp; creeping up to God – </p>
  <p>as if there were no devil – &amp; indeed </p>
  <p>can there be where God is.</p>
  <p>It has been the <span class="unclear">sharp[?]</span> fighting that</p>
  <p>is not defence, but a sort of ineffective </p>
  <p><span class="unclear">assculing[?]</span> &amp; striving. Striving is a
  </p>
  <p>mistake. Of a spiritual-teacher, I </p>
  <p>should urge absorbing – being interested –</p>
  <p>– best of all last.</p>
  <p>Of course when there is no echo
  </p>
  <p>Death comes. Death is the unechoing </p>
  <p>Herod <span class="unclear">died[?]</span> of this disease, &amp; not of</p>
  <p>worms.</p>
  <p>– I ordered a pot of white violets </p>
  <p>for Painter. A pot of green leaves arrives </p>
  <p>&amp; a <span class="unclear">name[?]</span>– <span style="text-decoration:underline">the White
                Czar</span>!</p>
  <p>So Painter has no <span class="unclear">blooms[?]</span> – merely
  </p>
  <p>a title. The <span class="unclear">unreality[?]</span> of things</p>

  <p>A rain as of April has fallen – </p>
  <p>Hennie’s heart is broken to Herod. </p>
  <p>We work together; Bernhard is on the </p>

  <p>I am happy after an arid, desperate

  <p>One afternoon I recall.</p>
  <p>It is Wednesday, &amp;, as one abandoned </p>
  <p>of hope I am curled up on my bed</p>

  <p>The talk is chiefly of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Don Giovanni</span> –
  </p>
  <p>but in truth we meet to wail.</p>
  <p>With Painter it is a season of
  </p>
  <p>absolute barrenness – he is lying low. </p>
  <p>I tell him I shall say to Bernhard
  </p>
  <p>“There is not a sign of him” left, “Not </p>
  <p>a sign” he murmurs, “When Bern-
  </p>
  <p>-hard is by – I am in eclipse.”</p>
  <p>I amuse him from a heart, dropping
  </p>
  <p>like a stalactite-cave.</p>

  <p>about him of endless en-</p>

  <p>the mystery! He is not in

  <p>the World – in Society – Philanthropy, </p>
  <p>Business … With what </p>
  <p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Keres</span> has he then engagements?</p>

  <p>when she shall have heard </p>
  <p>the story from him – “It would </p>

  <p>playing a last card he </p>
  <p>tells all the mad rigmarole </p>
  <p>of the libretto – chuckling </p>
  <p>over its formal bits of
  </p>
  <p>Eighteenth Century “business” </p>
  <p>&amp; humour – sliding </p>
  <p>lissome eyes down the </p>

  <p>unabashed follies of </p>
  <p>the plot, &amp; ending on a </p>
  <p>note of veritable awe </p>
  <p>at the grip of the Stone

  <p>He sees a play – I do </p>
  <p>not – Opera &amp; Satire seem </p>
  <p>to me to exhaust the </p>

  <p>when he reached the door </p>
  <p>“I have noticed you <span class="unclear">don’t[?]</span></p>
  <p>think so much of your </p>
  <p>Baby lately” Of course he </p>
  <p>flew for the chocolate, with </p>
  <p>such perfect womanhood
  </p>
  <p>ordering &amp; pleading from </p>
  <p>the tiny bed. Fay was
  </p>
  <p>enchanted.</p>
  <p>Then wicked Michael told of Dara L.’s </p>
  <p>remark, after she had praised </p>
  <p>Shannon’s beauty, his sweet </p>
  <p>mouth (“He hasn’t got one at
  </p>
  <p>all” interpolates Fay) &amp; turned </p>
  <p>to Fay’s own portrait “He is
  </p>
  <p>exactly like a M<span style="text-decoration:underline"><sup>r</sup></span> Wright, who</p>
  <p>taught me drawing 30 years ago; </p>
  <p>&amp; very like a clergyman I
  </p>
  <p>used to know”.</p>
  <p>At the end Michael, pointing to </p>
  <p>her velvet stomarcher, asks </p>
  <p>“Do you know what this demands?”</p>
  <p>“No – ”</p>
  <p>“A Cochon d’Or” ___ &amp; he flies.</p>
  <p>“Mind you remember <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">M</span><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span

  <p>harasses the flight. “Let me see – Wright </p>
  <p>that’s the name!” “Yes – 30 years ago!”</p>
  <p>- - - &amp; he is gone.

  <p>April 7<sup>th.</sup></p>
  <p>There was a Spanish heat-
  </p>
  <p>wave yesterday. For a few hours </p>
  <p>Loved &amp; I walked to &amp; fro in the sunshine. </p>
  <p>To-day extreme scowl &amp; flutter of wind: </p>
  <p>Henrie curled up by the fire.</p>

  <p>I have sent a chocolate Easter Fish </p>

  <p> </p>
  <p>A child at the zoo said '' Tiger, look at

  <p>me''. At last she threw into the den her </p>

  <p>The tiger pushed out a paw – no egg, but </p>

  <p>Such primroses from Janet Dodge!</p>
  <p>I have written:</p>
  <p>A fresh &amp; immediate note of thanks </p>
  <p>for the primroses, dear Janet. </p>
  <p>Among the difficult Arts of </p>
  <p>Beautiful Living the Art </p>
  <p>of gathering &amp; presenting primroses </p>
  <p>is scarcely ever learnt. Janet </p>
  <p>is perfect in it. One usually </p>
  <p>receives primroses with a sense </p>
  <p>of nervous prostration, such </p>
  <p>as a picture-gallery produces; </p>
  <p>&amp; with an inarticulate hatred </p>
  <p>for the giver. But I lift out of </p>
  <p>an orderly box little separate </p>
  <p>nosegays, their tender stems, </p>
  <p>that always make me think </p>
  <p>of the feet of Arab girls that </p>
  <p>have the heels &amp; nails flushed </p>
  <p>with henna, all ready to be </p>
  <p>dipped in water. I bring out </p>
  <p>the great ivory Leeds bowl,
  </p>
  <p>I set the primroses' feet to </p>
  <p>shine under its deep bath; &amp; </p>
  <p>there are the primroses in their </p>
  <p>orient yellow, giving out their </p>
  <p>languid perfume. – sweet girls, </p>
  <p>but not to me of the West.</p>
  <p>I bless Janet &amp; so will Michael </p>

  <p>He has liked the beginning of Act I – the </p>

  <p>She has ableness of character – </p>

  <p>so the devoted Henry discusses leases </p>

  </p>
  <p>Sonnet.</p>
  <p>He is disappointed in Sabbatai – </p>
  <p>because he conceives Rénan’s </p>
  <p>Jesus, repeated dramatically in the </p>
  <p>central actions of his life. He would </p>
  <p>even have the cock crow thrice. He </p>
  <p>holds with Rénan, there was absolute </p>
  <p>disillusion when Jerusalem was </p>

  <p>– &amp; then went about seeking a sign. </p>
  <p>In Christ, I, Michael, find a fulfilled </p>
  <p>Ideal, in Sabbatai the wreck of a man </p>
  <p>who is not a hypocrite – who is rejected </p>

  <p>in him of the fluency of faith.</p>
  <p>Painter has always felt profoundly </p>
  <p>the tragedy of Christ – he would have </p>
  <p>liked our Sabbatai to have something </p>
  <p>of his richness of allure, his tenderness. </p>
  <p>This was not in our scope.</p>
  <p>We speak of Rossetti. “You are like him –” </p>
  <p>“No, Michael, Rossetti was one of the original </p>
  <p>minds of his time. I am not that. </p>
  <p>I am a spectator, doubled by the actor. </p>
  <p>That means I am a critic. </p>
  <p>I am the greatest spectator I have </p>
  <p>ever known”. Of his painting he will not </p>
  <p>speak, but much of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">its</span> his life, in its</p>
  <p>current of change &amp; fate –</p>
  <p>He likes the Palace, it is not hostile to </p>
  <p>him. He likes its sense of solidity – that </p>

  <p>she shrieks &amp; cries out. Her </p>
  <p>old father comes in, angry at </p>
  <p>her break-down, insistent that </p>
  <p>she shall go away. Firmly he </p>
  <p>drags her out.
  </p>
  <p>Tristan wakes – alone in the storm </p>
  <p>– the wind blows now, the doors
  </p>
  <p>close with a thud, the windows </p>
  <p>beat. He is alone in Hell – alone
  </p>
  <p>with his doom, that everything he </p>
  <p>does is sin, that he is in the velocity
  </p>
  <p>of a great anguish forever – in the Confusion </p>

  <p>up for the Ages – superhuman

  <p>as a Buddha. On the shutters </p>

  <p>Yes, the Forest here is <span style="text-decoration:underline">Over-forest </span>–</p>

  <p>We waked with the wish to </p>
  <p>live on our bed. I was stark </p>
  <p>&amp; dumb with over-bearing </p>
  <p>fatigue when I got here. </p>
  <p>The first morning we went along </p>

  <p>Land-lady said we were near </p>

  <p>Now we had grown confused in </p>

  <p>letters if <span style="text-decoration:underline">Leigh</span> were near – they</p>
  <p>replied they did not know </p>
  <p>its situation – so we concluded </p>
  <p>all was well. But at the </p>
  <p>mention of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Bank</span>, we realised</p>
  <p>our error. By cross-questioning </p>
  <p>we discovered that the rooty </p>
  <p>path was the woodland way
  </p>
  <p>to Bank. It is indeed strange. </p>
  <p>I thought I was going crazy on </p>
  <p>that rooty path.</p>
  <p>Of course we never go that side </p>
  <p>of the woods, &amp; we refer to the </p>

  <p>Michael “I like all the woods on </p>
  <p>the other side, but I can’t abide </p>
  <p>these woods”.</p>
  <p>I am not a bit nervous or unhappy </p>
  <p>in any other part of the Forest. </p>
  <p>On Monday afternoon we drove
  </p>
  <p>round by Stoney Cross to look <span class="add">⟨in vain⟩</span> for</p>

  <p>The Second Sunday</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The top story of Paragon is finished. </p>
  <p>We have heard that Bernhard has </p>
  <p>been called to Paris on business. </p>
  <p>So <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">not</span><span class="add">⟨no⟩</span> Forest meeting! There is</p>
  <p>such a small element of
  </p>
  <p>Time in my relation with him </p>
  <p>I scarcely feel this check. We </p>
  <p>reached the perfect moment </p>
  <p>ten days ago &amp; within the </p>
  <p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">radious</span> radius of its perfection</p>
  <p>all time is included. Had he </p>
  <p>come fretted to the Forest – had </p>
  <p>he come conjoined, not his </p>
  <p>single self, all my future </p>
  <p>might have become temporal, </p>
  <p>that is now infinite.</p>
  <p>He returns Tommy’s Poems </p>
  <p>unrepentant – he still feels as if
  </p>
  <p>they were rather promising, but </p>
  <p>hopelessly unmusical exercises. </p>
  <p>The utmost they extract from him </p>
  <p>is a certain consent, but with </p>
  <p>no warmth.
  </p>
  <p>The last criticism is merited to a </p>
  <p>degree – Tommy’s hateful mind chills </p>
  <p>the creativeness of his emotion. </p>
  <p>But his work is not promising –
  </p>
  <p>it is <span style="text-decoration:underline">performance</span> – it is</p>
  <p>a little satyr of Pan, not a little </p>
  <p>Apollo or Hermes – still the </p>
  <p>whole God,
    <span style="text-decoration:underline">born</span>, not in the womb.</p>

  <p>We are cheered by a delightfully </p>
  <p>confidential letter from Fay – </p>
  <p>Mary’s single visit – the Pelleas &amp; </p>
  <p>Melissande of Sarah &amp; M<span style="text-decoration:underline"><sup>rs</sup></span> Pat –</p>
  <p>these are lightly evoked. </p>
  <p>Also by post comes a little </p>

  <p>We are getting happy in our Forest.
  </p>
  <p>And the Down &amp; brakes behind </p>

  <p>The oaks now are rejuvenating –
  </p>

  <p>– one seems to smell the softness of </p>

  <p> </p>
  <p>Then on the Tuesday before we started </p>
  <p>for the Forest – July 12<span style="text-decoration:underline"><sup>th</sup></span> – The Artists</p>
  <p>dined with us. Mary had got </p>
  <p>up a Bach afternoon, &amp; Fay &amp; </p>
  <p>Michael met there, &amp; from </p>
  <p>thence journeyed to Paragon </p>
  <p>together. Unfortunately the </p>
  <p>difficult great music had wrought </p>
  <p>Fay to nervous fatigue &amp; headache. </p>
  <p>He looked white, as if dying </p>
  <p>in mind, at his arrival, though </p>
  <p>he was so excited he poured out
  </p>
  <p>a stream of talk on Bach. </p>
  <p>A prelude he heard was like </p>
  <p>the outpouring of a bag of </p>
  <p>jewels – dusk, with here &amp; </p>
  <p>there one flash to measure </p>
  <p>the wealth of the cold gem-</p>
  <p>cascade. Bach composes on the
  </p>
  <p>brain itself, his music is organic </p>
  <p>only on that instrument – as
  </p>
  <p>some music is only organic on </p>
  <p>the heart, or the nerve-centres. </p>
  <p>He is the most taxing of all </p>
  <p>musicians – his high demand is </p>
  <p>almost of super-human quality. </p>
  <p>When we dine the heat &amp; the </p>
  <p>festive dishes, meeting Bach in </p>
  <p>the poor Painter’s body, produce </p>
  <p>a deadness of nausea – we
  </p>
  <p>quite fear the worst. But he revives.</p>

  <p>has weeping as its promise. This </p>

  <p>In response to a letter from Michael, </p>

  <p>“Depart all ye that are out of

  <p>two? Could you be patient to learn </p>
  <p>the tongue of the moss, &amp; all the accents </p>
  <p>of the trees? Henry knows not. I wonder.</p>
  <p>I would far rather you were at the </p>
  <p>Palace with your clay. Painter, you have </p>
  <p>been called by one who is not your enemy,
  </p>
  <p>“an abstract eel”, &amp; this too is for me your </p>
  <p>charm. Abstractness <span style="text-decoration:underline">with attention</span></p>
  <p>is far better than “joy with economy.”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>I cannot turn to the Forest now that </p>
  <p>you have set me on the track </p>
  <p>of art, – &amp; yet there is a cherry-tree </p>
  <p>the poets wake to at dawn – kaleidoscopic </p>
  <p>in its light through pointed leaves, –
  </p>
  <p>where the birds &amp; they remember the </p>
  <p>cherry-harvest – &amp; twitter in their old </p>
  <p>age of song; and there is the strange </p>
  <p>reddening &amp; re-budding of the summer </p>

  <p>Not a high-road, except for a
